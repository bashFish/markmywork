The same routine over again, I ask my mum with sarcasm \"how long will we stay there this time\" as she normally replies only ,\"Grace only 30 minutes long this time\". But it never usually lasts just 30 minutes. As soon as I step inside the red, brick house I smell a tray of freshly baked cookies coming out of the oven! Grandmother walking at quite a fast pace if you ask me, holding the tray off cookies right into my face. Of course I would have kindly accepted the lovely treat.\\nI\\'m jolting up and down the corridor seeing there\\'s nothing else joyful to do. Quickly stopping myself I see a set of staircases looking as long as an elephant\\'s trunk. The smell of disgusting and quite revolting fumes walking down the stairs there leads a mysterious, hidden doorway. I am about to steer the door handle but the door creaks open instead. With a feeling of a peculiar and dreading feeling I tiptoe one foot at a time until the door shuts close. I am completely frozen head to toe, trying to reach my hands to the door handle.

How did I get here? Well lets go back 18 hours when this all started.*TRIPLE KILL* I was sitting on my couch playing videogames and talking with my friends.I could smell the doritos sitting on the floor and the guacamole getting salty. We were having fun until the TV switched the channek to an emergency broadcast.\"News have just came in from NASA indicating that there is a wormhole in the sky. The exact location of the wormhole has not been found but stay safe as no one knows the danger the world could experience. I ignored it thinking it wouldn\\'t be a big deal but the I heard a loud horrible screech coming from the sky. As I looked out I saw a large cage with a gruesome bulging eye attached to it. It spoke some wierd distorted language that I couldn\\'t understand but then it slowly started talking english. It said,\"Hello earthlings I am CAGE, I are here to inhabit this world, if you are not gone in a day I will have to exterminate you.\\nI can hear loud screams all around me. I could see little children running through the greasy, narrow alleyways trying to escape but the CAGE caught them and locked them up inside of him. I looked outside my apartment window and saw a dumpster down there. It was a far fall but it was my only choice. *Aaaaaaah* The horrid stench of the garbage sneaked into my nose as I felt my leg bleed. I ducked my head under the dumpster for a few hours until I decided to see if it was still there. It looked as if I was in a barren desert in Africa. The red sand burned my feet as I ran across the desert trying to find people. I was about to kick the bucket until I fell into the ground. As I opened my eyes I was blinded by the lights. A man wearing a surgical eyes and skin more pale than the snow was playing with me eyelids seeing if I was alive. I shrieked and hopped off the bed. I was so scared if felt as my skin came off. He said he was checking if I was still alive.\\nHe explained that he found a way to get rid of the CAGE by shooting highly concentrated plutonium missile at it. It would burn it in a second. Unfortunately he was too old to operate the machine and asked if I could do it. I agreed as there would be no other way to save the world.I could feel the heat from the missile emitting off my skin. I aimed at the cornea of the CAGE as my hands trembled. I knew that if I made a mistake it would be game over for the world. *3 *2 *1... *Pssssssst. The missile whistled in the air as it flew at the CAGE. A second later i saw it. The CAGE was melting away while shrieking in pain. I did it. I SAVED THE WORLD.\\n6 YEARS LATER...\\nIt has been a few years now and the world is still healing. Currently thae air sells like crispy bacon and eggs as there is still radiation lurking in the air but not enough to kill you.

Finally, after what 5 years of staying in this country we were allowed to go visit grandma in Sweden.\\n\"Julie, can you go grab your clothes that mum placed on your bed?\" I said while folding Geremy\\'s clothes.\\n\"Sure\" she replied.\\nI have a twin, Geremy, he\\'s 15, always dependent on others and extremely ungrateful. I\\'m a few minutes younger than Geremy and that lets him believe he has the right to make me his slave. Anyways forget him, I also have a younger sister, Julie, she\\'s 11 and she\\'s the favourite one. I see why though, she gets straight A\\'s and is really sporty, but the sportiest one out of us 3 is Geremy, he\\'s a track runner. He also plays basketball, soccer and cricket.\\nOnce we finished packing, we gently placed all the suit cases in the boot and Geremy jumped into the car. Mum and dad went to go buy some snacks for our plane ride to Sweden. After a few minutes they came back.\\n\"LOLLIES!\" Julie screamed as she bolted up to mum.\\n\"There for the plane, you can only have one now\" mum said stepping back.\\nWe all got into the car and drove to the airport, when we reached the smell of the airport came back to me in a flash. I could almost feel myself getting lost again. It was packed with people arriving and departing.\\n\"Alright everyone show me your wrists let me write my phone number down\" dad said.\\nHe does that everytime we enter a crowded area after Geremy and I got lost. We waited about an hour then FINALLY it was out turn to board the plane. I showed my ticket and entered the plane.\\nI took the window seat and next to me was Julie, She already got the tv remote and started searching up movies she could watch, I did the same. Throughout the whole flight I watched a movie called \\'The Doorway\\' is was about a girl getting lost and a creepy, sketchy old man taking her to a door of wishes or something, I fell asleep half way it was that boring. All of a sudden I was busting toilet and needed to go. I told Julie that I\\'d be back in a second and began searching for the toilets. I saw someone I recognised, was that g-grandma?\\nI tried to ignore her and entered the bathroom. When I was done I washed my hands with the gruesome soap. The thought of her wasn\\'t able to escape my mind. I gathered all my confidence and decided to go up to that lady sitting in front of the toilets that seemed to be my grandma. I left the bathroom and to my surprise it was a completely different, young man siting in the same spot. I somehow made myself believe that I was just picturing thing but when I began searching for my family I spotted her again RIGHT NEXT TO MY MUM!  I rushed up to Julie who was laughing with mum and asked her who that lady was.\\n\"Oh that\\'s grandma, she thought she was going to visit us and flew to Australia, but then she took a flight back and somehow it was the same flight, can you believe that!\"\\nMy heart skipped a few beats, but I was soon okay. I waved to grandma and sat back the whole flight listening to music. Once we got of the plane I met grandma properly and we decided to go stay in a hotel near the beach for a while. It was fun and I actually enjoyed my time there unlike last time when I got sick.

I waved to grandma and sat back the whole flight listening to music. Once we got of the plane I met grandma properly and we decided to go stay in a hotel near the beach for a while. It was fun and I actually enjoyed my time there unlike last time when I got sick.

Scared, Jono decided he would go back to shore. That was a bad idea because as soon as he got out of the rip, he noticed a shark looming up behind them, gradually getting closer and closer to them. The two boys struggled and struggled but knew that the shark would eventually get to them and when it did, surprisingly it didn\\'t attack them but instead talked to them. \"Come to my palace, 20 nautical miles east, and you will find me waiting there, ready for your quest.\" Reluctantly, the duo decided to go there but knew that when they got there, it would not be an easy task they needed to complete.\\nWhen they got to their destination, they didnt find anything there but ocean. Confused, Jono decided to look around their surroundings. There was nothing but ocean but then, he noticed a shipwreck. He drifted toward it and when he was above it, swum down to explore. He noticed that strangely, all the fish were gone and all that remained was the coral and de-formed peices of wood. Then, he saw a flash of gold appear behind him and turned towards it. He was amazed by what he saw. It was a man with full gold armour, spotted with aged seagrass. At first, he didn\\'t know who it was but then noticed the massive gold trident in the Sea God\\'s muscular arm. It was Poseidon.\\nJaw-dropped, Jono asked him why he was here \"Why did you invite me here?\" he asked with general questioning, but the Sea God thought it was a joke and laughed so loud, he must\\'ve caused an underwater earthquake.\\n\"Oh you know Smith, you know.\" he boomed.\\n\"How do you know my last name?\" Jono asked, not really wanting to know the answer. He was tempted to leave but would he want to anger the god of the sea? He didn\\'t really care, so he went back into the water and swum up to meet his best friend. But as soon as he left, the muscules in his body stopped working and he floated back down to the god.\\n\"\\'Sup\" he said desperately, when he was on the ground. \"Just checking the water temperature.\"\\n\"You disrespect me boy.\" Poseidon snarled, thrusting the blades of his trident towards him, striking him down in an instant.\\nUnexpectedly, as soon as the blades struck Jono down, he came back to life, this time, a glowing persona.

He was tempted to leave but would he want to anger the god of the sea? He didn\\'t really care, so he went back into the water and swum up to meet his best friend.

He wasn\\'t in his bedroom or anywhere he could remember. Tall leafy hedges surrounded him, casting giant shadows over everything. He seemed to be in a hedge maze. Jerry had no idea where he was so he just walked, in hope he would find something like an exit. A left turn, a right, right at the fork and left again. He walked for a few minutes until he spotted something. On the floor lay a map. A paper map like the one you would find at a theme park. It was a theme park like he thought.

Nothing.\\nJerry walked back tracing his steps. What did it mean by behind you? The map appeared in view again. Jerry picked it back up. There were some small words he didn\\'t notice before. This always had to happen to him. \"You want to know were the exit is? Behind you,\" Jerry read again. He turned and nothing was there. The sun was getting low. How long had he been in here? He had no food, no water and a liar map.  Jerry looked at the map for a way out. The maze was scribbled out. Jerry climbed up the hedge to try get out again. Hedges as far as the eye can see. The maze looked infinite. But the maze looked like a circle and circle mazes have something in the middle. It was worth a shot. He climbed back down and began wandering inwards. He walked for a long time. When Jerry was almost tired out, the centre of the maze appeared. It was a garden, with a rainbow of flowers. Water features decorated the garden and in the middle of it all a door. He walked to the door, ignoring the rest of the garden. The door was light brown, with a golden knob. Jerry grabbed the knob, twisted and pushed.\\nHe was blinded for a few seconds but when he opened his eyes he was back in the middle of the theme park. People chatting, rides blaring their music and the midday sun throwing light over everything. \"That was weird, it was the afternoon when I escaped but now it\\'s midday,\" Jerry said aloud. He collapsed in a bench and gave his legs some rest. A man in a grey hoodie walked up to him.\\n\"Hey, you were in a giant maze, right?\" the man asked.\\n\"How do you know and yes, why are you asking?\" Jerry replied, standing up, suddenly suspicious.\\n\"Come with me, now,\" the man threatened.

He wasn\\'t in his bedroom or anywhere he could remember. Tall leafy hedges surrounded him, casting giant shadows over everything. He seemed to be in a hedge maze. Jerry had no idea where he was so he just walked, in hope he would find something like an exit. A left turn, a right, right at the fork and left again. He walked for a few minutes until he spotted something. On the floor lay a map. A paper map like the one you would find at a theme park. It was a theme park like he thought. Deep in Jerry\\'s brain, a memory was retrieved. He was at the theme park, he went to the maze and how he got in was completly unknown. Nothing else.\\nHe reached down and snatched the map up. It had a few words faintly scribbled on it. \"Behind you,\" Jerry read, filling with fear. He had seen a few horror movies. Jerry didn\\'t look back. He ran, somehow dodging all dead ends. His heart beat faster than a proffesional drummer. A leafy wall stood in front of him. Dead end. He looked around. He expected some sort of creature to turn around the corner. Nothing.\\nJerry walked back tracing his steps. What did it mean by behind you? The map appeared in view again. Jerry picked it back up. There were some small words he didn\\'t notice before. This always had to happen to him. \"You want to know were the exit is? Behind you,\" Jerry read again. He turned and nothing was there. The sun was getting low. How long had he been in here? He had no food, no water and a liar map.  Jerry looked at the map for a way out. The maze was scribbled out. Jerry climbed up the hedge to try get out again. Hedges as far as the eye can see. The maze looked infinite. But the maze looked like a circle and circle mazes have something in the middle. It was worth a shot. He climbed back down and began wandering inwards. He walked for a long time. When Jerry was almost tired out, the centre of the maze appeared. It was a garden, with a rainbow of flowers. Water features decorated the garden and in the middle of it all a door. He walked to the door, ignoring the rest of the garden. The door was light brown, with a golden knob. Jerry grabbed the knob, twisted and pushed.\\nHe was blinded for a few seconds but when he opened his eyes he was back in the middle of the theme park. People chatting, rides blaring their music and the midday sun throwing light over everything. \"That was weird, it was the afternoon when I escaped but now it\\'s midday,\" Jerry said aloud. He collapsed in a bench and gave his legs some rest. A man in a grey hoodie walked up to him.\\n\"Hey, you were in a giant maze, right?\" the man asked.\\n\"How do you know and yes, why are you asking?\" Jerry replied, standing up, suddenly suspicious.\\n\"Come with me, now,\" the man threatened. He drew a small knife. \"Don\\'t yell or else.\"\\nQuestion: Has the student engaged with the prompt?\\nAnswer: ',\n",

When we got there nothing looked weird, we asked him what\\'s weird about this house but when we turned around he had gone. The only thing left was the keys on the floor. Suddenly a big gust of wind wept past us but we were already there so we got the keys and went inside.\\nWe unlocked the door and we both stepped inside and all of a sudden a bright light flashed before our eyes only to realise we were somewhere completely different.

After ten minutes of trying to calm Jordan down Ayden finally managed to calm him down. \"Now I have read a story on this and I think I know how to get out of it but you have to listen to me ok?\" asked Ayden.\\nSo Jordan decided to listen only because he wanted to leave this place. 15 minutes had passed and Jordan is starting to loose hope but Ayden is still trying really hard. It was like 9:30pm and no sign of them leaving anytime soon. Ayden was trying to figure out which direction to go in and Jordan was trying to figure out where they were in the world.\\nAfter Jordan had realised where they were (which was Africa) Ayden knew exactily where to go. Ayden lead the way to the exit which keep in mind was 2 hours away. By the time they reached the door Ayden had just enough of Jordan. As they stepped through the door they were back at home but at a different house this time and they had no idea where there house was.\\nIt was very late I think it was around midnight and Jordan felt like passing out but Ayden was very persistent and didn\\'t want to rest until he got home. So Ayden and Jordan started to walk in a random direction. After like half an hour they saw something very familiar but they had to get closer to tell.

They stormed up to him and asked him what was going on.\\nThe man explained that \"It was a test to firstly see if you too could work together and secondly help out an old man if needed and you passed.\" We were shocked.

Nothing.\\nTold you! It\\'s called a bad ending, never happens enough in other storys I say.\\nQuestion: Has the student used the five senses in their writing?\\nAnswer: ',\n",

She cringes back, her eyes squinting into tight slits. The surrondings were highly unfamilliar, cages were hanging\\nall around her, the metal glinting slightly from the rain. Where was she?\\nHer breaths were shallow, she strained her brain trying to figure out where she was last. She looks down at herself, a red braclet shines for a second in the moonlight. The chains around\\nher shook, a couple screams came from her left. \"Other people...\" She whispers. They sounded like children, \"What is this place...\" She asks herself.The rain pours down on her cage,\\nmaking little clinking noises. \"Hey-\" There was a voice next to her. \"Who\\'s there?!\" She asks suddenly. She waits for a response, hearing a sharp inhale she asks again.\\n\" Who\\'s there?!!\" There was nothing, she tried to go backwards, but it ended up just tipping her cage.\\n\"Wait I\\'m in the air..\" She says. Looking down at the ground. Her lovely little moment was interuppted by a couple of loud voices down below. \"COME ON GET MOVING!! \"A womans\\nvoice rips through the rain. She heared a lever being pulled, and suddenly her cage started to descend down. All the cages made a clunk when they hit the bottom. The womans voice\\nwas still yelling. \"COME ON PEOPLE, CHOP CHOP.\" One by one the cages got loaded up into a truck, even hers. The face of the woman was there for a second, It was wrinkled up into a\\nsnarl, her blonde hair tied neatly into a ponytail behind her head. She had a brown cap on, with baggy black pants and a vest.\\nThe truck started to move, she looks around her. Theres a little girl, about 5, her face looks like that one emoji, the one with the shocked blue and yellow face. She feels droopy, but she tries to stay\\nawake...\\nA sudden stop wakes her. The roller door of the truck opens, revealing a bright light. \"Oh- I slept..\" A guy walks through, unlocking their cages. The woman yells \"ALRIGHT GET OUT AND WE\\'LL SORT CHA!\".\\nshe huddled out, getting pushed around. \"Hey!\" She exclaims, shortly after a kid pulled her laces apart. She got into a line next to the same girl who was looking extremley petrified. \"POPPY CLASS!\\nRUBY MARS! ELSIE FRANKLINGTON! AND LIZZY BARK! YOU ARE IN ROOM 34.\" The four girls huddled forward and followed a tall man. \"NEXT- MAXINE ummm..You don\\'t have a last name...But anyway..\\nDARCY MOORE, EVA PEARLS, MAISY LOCKER! YOU ARE IN ROOM 67.\"... MAX......\\nMax, max, max...OH! MY NAME! YES!!! Last thing I knew I was moving to my new house in Perth. \"Strange..\" I said to myself. \"WELL THEN GET MOVING MAXINE!\" The woman screeches at me. I\\nhuddle forwards, cathcing up to the girl named Darcy. She turns to me, her face was red, looking like she was crying. \" Uhm..Are you okay??\" I ask, looking at her with my \"totally\" sympathetic eyes.\\n\"Uh.....huh..\" She says slowly, turning away from her and walking to the others.\\nThey walk us to a cabin, on the edge of a cliff. \"Alright, this is where you will jump off into that lake. Do it or- You don\\'t want to know.\" Eva went first, her screams echoing in the air. Then Maisy. Darcy..\\nand Max last.\\nI squint my eyes, the fall felt like forever. Finally. She hit the water. Her arms and legs stopped working...Her head floats under the water...\\nQuestion: Has the student used the five senses in their writing?\\nAnswer: ',\n",

Their soul...\\nI was one of the many travellers that had been kidnapped by the crew. It was my turn to run the as maze and I had a feeling I wouldnt make it out with a soul. My name was Eddie, Eddie Murphy and when the horn blared I would need to run for my life, no soul...\\nAbout 30 seconds later the horn started blaring, when it stopped we could go. The crowd were cheering looking for their athelete. They bet on atheletes before we began. I myself was bet on by two crazy looking brothers, I was going to let them down. I wasn\\'t going to win.\\nIt stopped, we ran, the crowd roared. I started to enter some forks in the road. \"Which way, which way!?\" I franttically asked myself. I decided to go right because right is right, right? Anyway as I went right I saw a vile creature, the Wraith. It had a adventurer in its shadowy grasp and caried him away into a different part of the maze. Oh I didn\\'t tell you about the creatures well now you know.\\nI decided to keep right from my saying (right is always right right?) and kept making a steady pace avoiding any right turns that I heard a shriek in. and kept movind when i saw another person being dragged off into  bush. he begged and begged and begged to me to help him. I was about but no i couldnt be sidetracked by others. I needed to get out I couldn\\'t help someone reach glory and i lose my soul, so I continued with my everlong journey through the cage maze.\\nJust then I heard a shout it was the brothers \\'\\'Go left!\\'\\' one shouted to me. I decided to trust them because they had betted on me. and sure enough it was safe, for now...\\nI started losing hope \\'\\'Someone probably already found the exit.\\'\\' I muttered but then my soul would be sucked out by the wraiths by now. Just as I turned right I saw it... The exit. It was there sitting in all its glory> I started spriting away into the outside land but then the hedge just closed of the exit \\'\\'WHAT!\" I shouted \"HOW!\" I screamed. It was discouraging, very discouraging to see the finish line and just then see it dissapear again.\\nBut then it reapeared in front of him this time he ran through and the horns blared one final time...
