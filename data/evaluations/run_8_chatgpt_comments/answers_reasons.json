Paragraphs are important in creative writing because they help organize your thoughts and make it easier for the reader to follow the story. In your essay, you introduced different settings and events, such as the creepy alleyway and the cages, but you did not separate them into different paragraphs. This can make it difficult for the reader to understand the flow of the story. \n\nFor example, when you wrote about the thunder and rain, it would have been helpful to start a new paragraph to indicate a change in the setting and mood. Additionally, when you shifted from talking about the alleyway to being at school, it would have been clearer to start a new paragraph to show the change in location and time. \n\nI encourage you to practice using paragraphs in your writing to improve the organization and clarity of your narratives.

In literature, sensory writing is used to provide the reader with a vivid image or description of something. The five senses are sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. The best narratives should incorporate most of these senses in a thoughtful and original way.\nHas the student used the five senses in their writing?\n\n###\n\nGrade: 0\n\n###\n\nAnswer:", "reason": "Great job on writing your essay! I appreciate your effort in expressing your thoughts and feelings. However, I noticed that you did not use sensory language in your writing, which is why you received a grade of 0 for this question. Sensory language is the use of words that appeal to the five senses - sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch - to create a vivid image or description of something. In your essay, you did not describe any sensory details that would help the reader visualize the scene you were describing. For example, you could have described the sound of the thunder, the smell of the rain, or the feel of the wet pavement. By incorporating sensory language, you can make your writing more engaging and memorable for the reader.

Don't ask me why, it was because of what happened here long, long, ago...\n136 years ago\nIt was a sunny and joyful place all those years ago. The air smelled of a fresh spring. The florist giving free flowers to anyone who walked by. The cows mooed happily as they munched on grass. The sound of singing fill the air. The citizens were celebrating the good fortune of harvest they had. They had enough crops to feed themselves and the animals, who were all free roaming around town. Every week, the butcher would hunt down one animal for the small town, making a delicious feast from it. This week was pig, so all the citizens went to bed that night dreaming about bacon and ham.\nThe next morning was a dull day, as soon as the first of the citizens wake up though, the sky became bright blue. The trees danced happily in the light wind. There was one problem, the place was as silent as, well, nothing. There was no mooing, no oinking. Where was everything? They looked around, no animals to be seen.\nSuddenly a lady screamed,' the crop shed door is open!' All the citizens gathered around the shed faster than you could say pigs. The butcher slowly walked in and saw a terrible sight. The animals were munching down all the crops! 'We're doomed!' wailed a young girl. A young man about the age of 19 had an idea though, to trap the animals into paddocks. So they did. It was ingenious. That kept the animals from eating all the crops, for 76 years...\nIt was a beautiful day. The young man was now so old he could not even leave his house, but he was still celebrated as a savior. His house was all rusty, his photos were all covered in dust. This is the part when we get back to the cages, right about when the animals break out of the fences. Crash! The fences broke. After a brief meeting, they decided to go to the old man for help. He said after a while,' Maybe put them in metal cages, throw grass to them for feeding.' It was a success! The animals couldn't break through. The next day, the man passed away. The whole town grieved.\nPresent day\nClaudia, a young girl, rushed through the streets, all the way to the alley full of animal cages. Discreetly, she fed all of them, even the ones dangling from high above. 'I will get you out one day,' she whispered the the animals. She spent all her free time working on an early version of metal cutters. It was a very difficult job, but she managed to create one. Now she just needed a place to keep them.\nClaudia resented the animals kept in cages, she resented he great-grandfather for the idea of trapping them. The anger burned her skin. For some reason, the animals were veryh obedient to her, so she freed all the animals and told them to stay in the alley. She then took all the cages and made a fence-like shape. Next, she placed all the metal fences around where the wooden fences used to be, and took the animals into the pen. The citizens all were very angry about this, but once they saw that it was very impossible for the animals to get out, they cheered wildly, and had a celebration.

The sheep and pigs were the same. Even the man's best friend, dogs, were trapped in cages. Don't ask me why, it was because of what happened here long, long, ago...\n136 years ago\nIt was a sunny and joyful place all those years ago. The air smelled of a fresh spring. The florist giving free flowers to anyone who walked by. The cows mooed happily as they munched on grass. The sound of singing fill the air. The citizens were celebrating the good fortune of harvest they had. They had enough crops to feed themselves and the animals, who were all free roaming around town. Every week, the butcher would hunt down one animal for the small town, making a delicious feast from it. This week was pig, so all the citizens went to bed that night dreaming about bacon and ham.\nThe next morning was a dull day, as soon as the first of the citizens wake up though, the sky became bright blue. The trees danced happily in the light wind. There was one problem, the place was as silent as, well, nothing. There was no mooing, no oinking. Where was everything? They looked around, no animals to be seen.\nSuddenly a lady screamed,' the crop shed door is open!' All the citizens gathered around the shed faster than you could say pigs. The butcher slowly walked in and saw a terrible sight. The animals were munching down all the crops! 'We're doomed!' wailed a young girl. A young man about the age of 19 had an idea though, to trap the animals into paddocks. So they did. It was ingenious. That kept the animals from eating all the crops, for 76 years...\nIt was a beautiful day. The young man was now so old he could not even leave his house, but he was still celebrated as a savior. His house was all rusty, his photos were all covered in dust. This is the part when we get back to the cages, right about when the animals break out of the fences. Crash! The fences broke. After a brief meeting, they decided to go to the old man for help. He said after a while,' Maybe put them in metal cages, throw grass to them for feeding.' It was a success! The animals couldn't break through. The next day, the man passed away. The whole town grieved.\nPresent day\nClaudia, a young girl, rushed through the streets, all the way to the alley full of animal cages. Discreetly, she fed all of them, even the ones dangling from high above. 'I will get you out one day,' she whispered the the animals. She spent all her free time working on an early version of metal cutters. It was a very difficult job, but she managed to create one. Now she just needed a place to keep them.\nClaudia resented the animals kept in cages, she resented he great-grandfather for the idea of trapping them. The anger burned her skin. For some reason, the animals were veryh obedient to her, so she freed all the animals and told them to stay in the alley. She then took all the cages and made a fence-like shape. Next, she placed all the metal fences around where the wooden fences used to be, and took the animals into the pen. The citizens all were very angry about this, but once they saw that it was very impossible for the animals to get out, they cheered wildly, and had a celebration. That was the end of the cages, and animal cruelty in this town.\nNow, you may be wondering what about the dogs. If not, I'll tell you anyway.

They looked around, no animals to be seen.\nSuddenly a lady screamed,' the crop shed door is open!' All the citizens gathered around the shed faster than you could say pigs. The butcher slowly walked in and saw a terrible sight. The animals were munching down all the crops! 'We're doomed!' wailed a young girl. A young man about the age of 19 had an idea though, to trap the animals into paddocks. So they did. It was ingenious. That kept the animals from eating all the crops, for 76 years...\nIt was a beautiful day. The young man was now so old he could not even leave his house, but he was still celebrated as a savior. His house was all rusty, his photos were all covered in dust. This is the part when we get back to the cages, right about when the animals break out of the fences. Crash! The fences broke. After a brief meeting, they decided to go to the old man for help. He said after a while,' Maybe put them in metal cages, throw grass to them for feeding.' It was a success! The animals couldn't break through. The next day, the man passed away. The whole town grieved.\nPresent day\nClaudia, a young girl, rushed through the streets, all the way to the alley full of animal cages. Discreetly, she fed all of them, even the ones dangling from high above. 'I will get you out one day,' she whispered the the animals. She spent all her free time working on an early version of metal cutters. It was a very difficult job, but she managed to create one. Now she just needed a place to keep them.\nClaudia resented the animals kept in cages, she resented he great-grandfather for the idea of trapping them. The anger burned her skin. For some reason, the animals were veryh obedient to her, so she freed all the animals and told them to stay in the alley. She then took all the cages and made a fence-like shape. Next, she placed all the metal fences around where the wooden fences used to be, and took the animals into the pen. The citizens all were very angry about this, but once they saw that it was very impossible for the animals to get out, they cheered wildly, and had a celebration. That was the end of the cages, and animal cruelty in this town.\nNow, you may be wondering what about the dogs. If not, I'll tell you anyway. It was simple, most of them were adopted, but the few that weren't adopted, were trained by Claudia to guard the animals from a new threat, foxes and wolves. Now this is the end of this story.\n\n###\n\nQuestion:\nSensory language refers to the use of words to create a connection to any of the five senses.

In Athens, the worst day of the decade was coming. The high king, Papo, saw from his castle a ship bearing the flag of Crete. He saw the seven children tributes lining up at the docks. They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo's son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him. All the other tributes accepted their fates, but he wouldn't. \"Play it cool,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can escape The Maze. If I kill the beast that awaits us there, I can live as I have always lived in Athens.\" The boats arrived, took the tributes hostage, and sailed away to the worst island in the world.\nOnce Bellapapo and the other tributes landed in Crete, the king, Minos, took them in for a celebratory feast on his castle. He announced that if the tributes survived the beast, they would go home with 10 ass-loads of gold. (Ass being a donkey, what did you think it meant)? The castle sat on a big hill, which was surronded by water. Bellapapo had an idea. \"If this guy thinks I am the son of a god, he will be reluctant to send me in.\" After the main course had been delivered, Bellapapo claimed \"I am the son of Posieden, god of the sea. If you dare put a demigod in The Maze, you shall feel the wrath of Posiedon!\"\n\"Well, son of Posiedon,\" Drawled Minos, king of Crete,\" I am glad to host you. But you are a son of the SECOND most powerful god and from the SECOND most powerful city. I am the son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and rule the most powerful CITY!\" He screamed the last word, and as he did so, his ring flew out the window. Bellapapo, being ADHD and looking for something to do, ran and jumped out the window. King Minos thought: \"Ah well. We can do the trials with six kids.\" Meanwhile, Bellapapo was praying to Posiedon to save his neck. He noticed the waves were moving awkwardly. Suddenly, a wave lashed out of the water and coiled around Bellapapo like a snake, then tossed him to shore. He shrugged his shoulders, muttered a prayer to Posieden and truged up the hill back to the castle\n\"Into the maze, the time is now. \u2028You cannot live there's no way out. \u2028Into the maze and to the beast.\u2028That will rip you with all his teeth.\u2028Into the maze, and to your death.\u2028For the trouble that you parents made.\"\nThe locals were pumped that it was that time of year again. The weather was rainy, but they were taken aback when, unlike the usually cowards that they brought from Athens, one of the tributes seemed to be enjoying the attention. King Minos announced \"LET THE 3RD MAZE TRIALS, BEGIN!\" The tributes were thrown into the maze. Bellapapo told the tributes to hold onto a piece of string while he went searching for the beast. It didn't take long. He found the beast at an intersection between somewhere and something. From the waist down it was human. From the waist up, it was a bull.\n\"RAWR!\" Roared the beast.\u2028\"RAWR!\" Roared Bellapapo. The beast charged, trying to catch Bellapapo off guard. Bellapapo sidestepped and hooked the beast in the snout. The beast didn't seem fazed by it. He was used to pain. Those whips they used on him hurt more than anything else. Bellapapo kept on counter-attacking the beast, but it didn't seem to get injured or tired. Bellapapo tried a different approach. He ran at the beast, jumped on its back and ripped off his right tusk. \"RAWR!\" Bellowed the beast. Bellapapo didn't stop there. The clouds parted and the sun shone, a rainbow appeared as Bellapapo brought the tusk down onto the beasts head, killing it instantly.\nCrete, Athens, Greece and the world was shocked. It wasn't everyday you saw a mutant bull die to his own tusk. It probably would be put on 9news. Sadly, there were no TVs then. Bellapapo and the other tributes rejoiced of their freedom and hey, who doesn't want ten ass-loads of gold shipped to your kingdom. (Again, an ass is a donkey). Bellapapo was elected the general fo the Athenian army, and his first campain was against Crete. Seeing as most of Crete hated Minos, they didn't bother stopping him from taking over the country.

They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo's son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him.

They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo's son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him. All the other tributes accepted their fates, but he wouldn't. \"Play it cool,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can escape The Maze.

He announced that if the tributes survived the beast, they would go home with 10 ass-loads of gold. (Ass being a donkey, what did you think it meant)?

The clouds blew across the sky above an old, brown house on a big, tall hill. Inside that house was a little cage that was glinting in the light of the car's headlights that were currently driving past. Inside that cage, there was a little bird. This bird had lived in this cage it's whole entire life, but that bird did not like living in that cage. It was always very sad. The sound of silence was pleasing, until the Bird woke.\n\"Ough!!\" I yawned as I got out of bed. I flapped as I stood up, my yellow feathers shining, like daisy's in a paddock.\n\"Oh, come on!! Why do I have to be the only bird in the world stuck in this TINY little cage!!!\" I complained as I stamped my foot on the water bowl, making the water tip out, all over the floor.\n\"It is time that I finally got out of this cage!!!\" I yelled. \"I must make a plan! I'm sick of this!\"\n20 minutes later, I had brainstormed 5 possible ways to get out of cage.\n\"Okay, plan number 1: Noise.\" I said to myself.\nI jumped up onto the edge of the cage, squawking as loud as I could. 5 seconds later, the dreaded woman came up to me, and I kept squawking. She mumbled something unintelligable and walked off.\n\"Plan number 1 didn't work, so let's try plan number 2: Wire cutting.\" I exclaimed.\nSharpening my beak on the water bowl, I started to gnaw on the wires on the side of the grey cage. I tried my hardest, however I just couldn't do it. They were too thick.\n\"Okay, time to proceed to plan number 3: Worm impersonating.\nDigging throught the dirt, I discovered that ther was plastic underneath me.\n\"Great. Another failed plan.\" I thought to myself.\nTime to proceed to the 4th plan: Playing dead.\nI started squawking really loudly, but as the woman came to see me again, I jumped onto the ground and lay there still. She mumbled something again, and opened the cage door. I took my chance, and flew out, into the kitchen. She ran at me, however I was too quick. I jumped down and hopped out an open window, straight into a bin. I quickly scrambled out, and flew off. I was free! I couldn't beleive it! I flew around and found some food.

Sensory language is the use of words that appeal to the five senses: sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. It helps the reader to visualize and experience the story more vividly. In your writing, you did not describe the setting or the babies in a way that appeals to the senses. For example, you could have described the sound of the babies crying, the smell of the cages, or the texture of the blankets covering them.

It's small and cramped, but its the best that you can get in this city. Rain pours down on the plastic roof as i watch a family of rats scurry down the street. The city is a relic of the past, standing the test of time when others fell, but it is still not what it used to be. People living off the streets, scavenging for any little scraps of the rotten food they can find. I've heard rumers about what its like outside of the city and it sounds amazing. lush green feilds stretching as far as the eye can see. clear blue skys, unlike the dark poluted one inside the city. many people have tried and failed to escape. the city is like a maze, once you start moving, you will never find your way back. A squadren of heavily armoured soldiers march down the street, moving in unisen.  Their meant to protect us, but most of the time end up doing the oposite. I feel feet steping on my small hut, breaking through the thin layer of plastic that was protecting me from the elements. I have had enough with the soldiers abusing the less fortunate citizens. I catch one of them off gaurd when I reach out and rip one of thier guns from it's holster. Dashing through the streets, I know they wont be able to follow with the bits of scrap metal poorly atached to their clothes. I start to realise, I will never be able to find my way back to my shelter. I have been living ther for 16 years! how could I just abandon my entier life, where I was born and raised? I find another small alleyway and and run towards it. It's just now that I realise the size of what I just did. there is now way that I could resume my old life, its completly gone. The rain beats down on my skin as I fall into sleep.\nThe world flutters in and out of vision, as I slowly regain consiosness. In my drowzy state, I make a plan. It might not be the best one, but it's the only thing that I can think of. Gathering all the materials will be hard, but it will be worht it. The amount of food that I will need to keep me alive during my journey will be alot to find on the streets, but a couple trash piles should hold enough to keep me alive. The rain has stoped, wich means I can start my esacpe. slung over my shoulder is a small trash bag filled with everything I will need to survive. Food, Water and a blanket for warmth. I make my way through the winding walls of the city, trying to always go away from the central tower. Im looking down at the ground, when I bump into something. whiping my head up, I see a full squadren of soldiurs, betting on two rats fighting. One of them hears me and alerts the others. panic rising, Im frozen in place. The sound of a gun fiering snaps me out of it, but its to late. The bullet whent right through my leg. blood gushes out of the wound. I limp away as fast as I can, hearing the group go back to their game knowing I will die before from blood loss. The blanket I packed serves as a bandage, lessening the flow, but not enough to keep me concious. I strugle to stay awake, but its no use. I once again fall into a deep sleep\nThe blood must have clotted at the wound, because I wake up again. its brighter, signiling that I have been asleep for at least a day. I check up on the bandage. soaked in blood, just like I thought. The pain is bearable though, so I start making my way through the city again, making shure im carefull around more densly opulated areas. After days of wandering, my food storage starts to run low. I try to keep up my normal pace, but my starving body forces me to go slower. Im eating my last scrap of food, making the most of the it. All hope seems lost, my food and water suplies have been depleted, and I dont even know if I have made progress. Lightheaded and starving, I reach a dead end. I slump against the cold wall, waiting for death to come, but the wall behind me starts to shift. I fall back and see sunlight filtering through the leaves. Leaves! I have found my way out.

First, they should always open and close dialogue with speech marks. Second, before closing the speech marks, they should always use punctuation. Third, they should use speech tags to signal how a character has delivered the dialogue, ideally using descriptive words like \"muttered\" or \"declared\", rather than saying that \"he said\". Finally, they should start a new line whenever there is a new speaker.\nHas the student followed the rules of using dialogue?\n\n###\n\nGrade: 0\n\n###\n\nAnswer:", "reason": "Great job on writing a descriptive and engaging story! However, regarding the use of dialogue, I noticed that you did not follow the four key rules that were given in the question. You did not use speech marks to open and close dialogue, nor did you use punctuation before closing the speech marks. Additionally, you did not use speech tags to signal how a character has delivered the dialogue, and you did not start a new line whenever there was a new speaker. It is important to follow these rules when using dialogue to make it clear who is speaking and how they are speaking.

You have a strong narrative that keeps the reader engaged. However, you received a grade of 1 on the question of whether you used paragraphs.

Similarly, when you transition from describing your escape plan to describing your encounter with the soldiers, a new paragraph would have helped to signal the shift in the narrative. \n\nIn the future, try to use paragraphs to break up your writing into smaller, more manageable chunks.

You have shown creativity and imagination in your writing. Your use of descriptive language and sensory details really helped to bring the story to life. \n\nRegarding the graded remark, you have made a good effort to create dynamic characters. While the main character is not fully developed, you have given her some personality traits such as sarcasm and a sense of boredom. Additionally, you have created a sense of mystery and intrigue with the hidden doorway and the portal. \n\nHowever, there is room for improvement in terms of character development. You could try to give more depth to your characters by exploring their relationships, motivations, and backstories. This would help to make them more relatable and interesting to the reader. \n\nOverall, great work on your essay! Keep up the good work and continue to develop your writing skills.", "grade": 2}

You have a vivid imagination and your story is engaging. However, the reason for the grade of 1 is that you have not fully established a sense of setting. While you do mention the grandmother's house and the mysterious doorway, you do not provide enough detail about the surroundings or the geographical location. In order to fully establish a sense of setting, it is important to describe the environment in detail, including the sights, sounds, smells, and atmosphere.
