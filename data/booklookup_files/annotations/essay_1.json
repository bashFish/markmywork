            "Throughout the entirety of the novel, Shalley expresses the negative",
            "effects ambition can have on one's mental health, as it can corrupt",
            "somebody's views and values. Victor Frankenstein is shown to go clinically",
            "insane because of his endeavours, which leads to the descrution of",
