question;explanation
Has the student written a compelling opening?;This skill refers to the extent to which the student has grabbed the reader's attention from the first few lines of the narrative. This can be done in a number of ways, such as by beginning with some intense action, a thought-provoking question, or even a shocking statement.
Has the student "shown" and not "told"?;"Show, don't tell" is a writing technique that allows the reader to experience details of the story through actions, images, and sensory details, as opposed to simply telling the story what is happening. For example, rather than simply telling the reader that the "man is angry", the author could write that "the man clenched his fists", which is a sign of anger.
Has the student used a range of literary devices?;Literary devices can help the author provide the reader with a more vivid picture of what is being described. Alliteration, metaphor, similes, and repetition are all commonly used literary devices.
Has the student made an effort to create dynamic characters?;This skill refers to the fact that the best stories have characters who are multi-dimensional. These types of characters have relationships, backstories, motivations and aims, a complex personality, and manage to achieve growth or change by the end of the narrative.
Has the student established a sense of setting?;Setting refers to both geographical location and immediate surroundings. The best narratives tend to include both of these aspects of settings. A story that unfolds in the hurried chaos of New York is not the same if transplanted to an isolated island in the Pacific. A scene that takes place in a cramped room changes in meaning when it occurs in a vast forest.
Has the student varied their sentence structure?;Varied sentence structure refers to altering how different sentences in a work are structured. While it may be accurate to start every sentence with the same subject since the paragraph speaks only about one subject, such a paragraph would be boring and repetitive. One way to address this is to start sentences with a variety of word types, such as subjects, adjectives, nouns, and verbs.
Has the student varied their sentence length?;This skill refers to the idea that the best examples of creative writing use a mix of short, moderate, and long sentences. Short sentences have punch and are a great way to emphasise important points. Longer sentences add rhythm to your writing. By using both short and long sentences, you add interest and drama to your writing that helps to maintain your readers' attention.
Has the student written a story that follows the narrative arc?;"A narrative arc has five parts: 1) Exposition: Introduce characters, setting, and background. 2) Rising action: Increase conflict with a key event. 3) Climax: Story reaches peak tension, characters face tough decisions. 4) Falling action: Conflict resolves, loose ends addressed. 5) Resolution: Story ends, showing how characters and their world changed."
Has the student engaged with the prompt?;Every question that the students write will have a different prompt. The students must use this as a springboard for their story, and the highest scoring responses will incorporate the prompt into the story in a unique, abstract, and though-provoking way. The students will usually write the prompt
Has the student included dialogue?;Dialogue helps you create interesting characters and advance your story. It can share a character's past and uncover key plot points. It's also useful for building tension between characters and setting the story's atmosphere. Dialogue makes your story more engaging and dynamic.
Has the student followed the rules of using dialogue?;There are four key rules that the students should follow when using dialogue. First, they should always open and close dialogue with speech marks. Second, before closing the speech marks, they should always use punctuation. Third, they should use speech tags to signal how a character has delivered the dialogue, ideally using descriptive words like "muttered" or "declared", rather than saying that "he said". Finally, they should start a new line whenever there is a new speaker.
Has the student used paragraphs?;The student should use paragraphs in creative writing whenever there is a new person, place, even, or idea. This will help the reader follow the narrative as it progresses.
Has the student used the five senses in their writing?;Sensory language refers to the use of words to create a connection to any of the five senses. In literature, sensory writing is used to provide the reader with a vivid image or description of something. The five senses are sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch. The best narratives should incorporate most of these senses in a thoughtful and original way.
