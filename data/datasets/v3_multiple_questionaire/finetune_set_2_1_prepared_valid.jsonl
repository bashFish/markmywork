{"prompt":"The Cage\nThis was the city of Cage, where everything other than humans were trapped in cages for most of the time, the cows were in cages with 2 cows in one cage. The sheep and pigs were the same. Even the man's best friend, dogs, were trapped in cages. Don't ask me why, it was because of what happened here long, long, ago...\n136 years ago\nIt was a sunny and joyful place all those years ago. The air smelled of a fresh spring. The florist giving free flowers to anyone who walked by. The cows mooed happily as they munched on grass. The sound of singing fill the air. The citizens were celebrating the good fortune of harvest they had. They had enough crops to feed themselves and the animals, who were all free roaming around town. Every week, the butcher would hunt down one animal for the small town, making a delicious feast from it. This week was pig, so all the citizens went to bed that night dreaming about bacon and ham.\nThe next morning was a dull day, as soon as the first of the citizens wake up though, the sky became bright blue. The trees danced happily in the light wind. There was one problem, the place was as silent as, well, nothing. There was no mooing, no oinking. Where was everything? They looked around, no animals to be seen.\nSuddenly a lady screamed,' the crop shed door is open!' All the citizens gathered around the shed faster than you could say pigs. The butcher slowly walked in and saw a terrible sight. The animals were munching down all the crops! 'We're doomed!' wailed a young girl. A young man about the age of 19 had an idea though, to trap the animals into paddocks. So they did. It was ingenious. That kept the animals from eating all the crops, for 76 years...\nIt was a beautiful day. The young man was now so old he could not even leave his house, but he was still celebrated as a savior. His house was all rusty, his photos were all covered in dust. This is the part when we get back to the cages, right about when the animals break out of the fences. Crash! The fences broke. After a brief meeting, they decided to go to the old man for help. He said after a while,' Maybe put them in metal cages, throw grass to them for feeding.' It was a success! The animals couldn't break through. The next day, the man passed away. The whole town grieved.\nPresent day\nClaudia, a young girl, rushed through the streets, all the way to the alley full of animal cages. Discreetly, she fed all of them, even the ones dangling from high above. 'I will get you out one day,' she whispered the the animals. She spent all her free time working on an early version of metal cutters. It was a very difficult job, but she managed to create one. Now she just needed a place to keep them.\nClaudia resented the animals kept in cages, she resented he great-grandfather for the idea of trapping them. The anger burned her skin. For some reason, the animals were veryh obedient to her, so she freed all the animals and told them to stay in the alley. She then took all the cages and made a fence-like shape. Next, she placed all the metal fences around where the wooden fences used to be, and took the animals into the pen. The citizens all were very angry about this, but once they saw that it was very impossible for the animals to get out, they cheered wildly, and had a celebration. That was the end of the cages, and animal cruelty in this town.\nNow, you may be wondering what about the dogs. If not, I'll tell you anyway. It was simple, most of them were adopted, but the few that weren't adopted, were trained by Claudia to guard the animals from a new threat, foxes and wolves. Now this is the end of this story.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 2"}
{"prompt":"The Maze\nNo-one was fooled by the clear sky and the bright sun. In Athens, the worst day of the decade was coming. The high king, Papo, saw from his castle a ship bearing the flag of Crete. He saw the seven children tributes lining up at the docks. They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo's son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him. All the other tributes accepted their fates, but he wouldn't. \"Play it cool,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can escape The Maze. If I kill the beast that awaits us there, I can live as I have always lived in Athens.\" The boats arrived, took the tributes hostage, and sailed away to the worst island in the world.\nOnce Bellapapo and the other tributes landed in Crete, the king, Minos, took them in for a celebratory feast on his castle. He announced that if the tributes survived the beast, they would go home with 10 ass-loads of gold. (Ass being a donkey, what did you think it meant)? The castle sat on a big hill, which was surronded by water. Bellapapo had an idea. \"If this guy thinks I am the son of a god, he will be reluctant to send me in.\" After the main course had been delivered, Bellapapo claimed \"I am the son of Posieden, god of the sea. If you dare put a demigod in The Maze, you shall feel the wrath of Posiedon!\"\n\"Well, son of Posiedon,\" Drawled Minos, king of Crete,\" I am glad to host you. But you are a son of the SECOND most powerful god and from the SECOND most powerful city. I am the son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and rule the most powerful CITY!\" He screamed the last word, and as he did so, his ring flew out the window. Bellapapo, being ADHD and looking for something to do, ran and jumped out the window. King Minos thought: \"Ah well. We can do the trials with six kids.\" Meanwhile, Bellapapo was praying to Posiedon to save his neck. He noticed the waves were moving awkwardly. Suddenly, a wave lashed out of the water and coiled around Bellapapo like a snake, then tossed him to shore. He shrugged his shoulders, muttered a prayer to Posieden and truged up the hill back to the castle\n\"Into the maze, the time is now.  You cannot live there's no way out.  Into the maze and to the beast. That will rip you with all his teeth. Into the maze, and to your death. For the trouble that you parents made.\"\nThe locals were pumped that it was that time of year again. The weather was rainy, but they were taken aback when, unlike the usually cowards that they brought from Athens, one of the tributes seemed to be enjoying the attention. King Minos announced \"LET THE 3RD MAZE TRIALS, BEGIN!\" The tributes were thrown into the maze. Bellapapo told the tributes to hold onto a piece of string while he went searching for the beast. It didn't take long. He found the beast at an intersection between somewhere and something. From the waist down it was human. From the waist up, it was a bull.\n\"RAWR!\" Roared the beast. \"RAWR!\" Roared Bellapapo. The beast charged, trying to catch Bellapapo off guard. Bellapapo sidestepped and hooked the beast in the snout. The beast didn't seem fazed by it. He was used to pain. Those whips they used on him hurt more than anything else. Bellapapo kept on counter-attacking the beast, but it didn't seem to get injured or tired. Bellapapo tried a different approach. He ran at the beast, jumped on its back and ripped off his right tusk. \"RAWR!\" Bellowed the beast. Bellapapo didn't stop there. The clouds parted and the sun shone, a rainbow appeared as Bellapapo brought the tusk down onto the beasts head, killing it instantly.\nCrete, Athens, Greece and the world was shocked. It wasn't everyday you saw a mutant bull die to his own tusk. It probably would be put on 9news. Sadly, there were no TVs then. Bellapapo and the other tributes rejoiced of their freedom and hey, who doesn't want ten ass-loads of gold shipped to your kingdom. (Again, an ass is a donkey). Bellapapo was elected the general fo the Athenian army, and his first campain was against Crete. Seeing as most of Crete hated Minos, they didn't bother stopping him from taking over the country. And so, I'd like to say that they lived a long and happy life. Sadly, Minos faked his death. In reality, he was alive, and he sat with his most trusted advisors, plotting Bellapapo's demise.\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3"}

When Ronan was 16 his Dad died in a tragic diving accident while looking for underwater ruins, although at first he was discorouged to continue his passion for diving he then thought that if his Dad had died for this there must of been something down there. This brings us to today, a very important moment of ronans career.\n\"CLUNK,\" Ronan dropped all of his diving gear into the back of his pink, rickety Toyota Yaris that he has had for 10 years. The car sags down with all the weight, it smelt of the sea and it was barely alive but he still loved it. the engine starts and he drives off with all the gear rattling around in the back, its a decently long drive, maybe 2 hours or so but Ronan is excited all the way.\nThe car stops at a halt and Ronan gets out of the car as if he has only been in the car for 5 minutes, he is greeted by two British men with brown and grey beards and round glasses, they looked like brothers, they shake hands and introduce themselves, the men are both divers and marine bioligists. As Ronan is getting his wetsuit on he shows them a satellite image of the site they will be going to, to an untrained eye it just looks like an ordinary birds eye view picture of the ocean but to them its much more significant, the most vague outlines of a temple can be seen through the deep blue ocean that hides it, it looks promisimg but there is only one way to find out.\nRonan finishes changing and the men lead him over to the boat, it isn't a mssive industrial one but he was happy about that, he found that it was more comfortable to dive off small boats because the bigger ones were just daunting. The boat was white and it looked fresh.\nThey all got onto the boat and Ronan typed in the coardinates, they started the engine and set sail for a 45 minute trip on the water. \"We're here!\" One of the men shouted with the energy of a an 8 year old, Ronan gathered himself and his gear.

The father started praying and he seemed to as said “Momos” (the god of help) “please answer our call we are begging you, me and my daughter have been teleported to an unknown place, please bring us back to earth” he moaned. And nothing, two whole hours went by, no water, no food, nothing. Muhammed (the dads name) yelled in anger “I knew he wasn’t able to help” he said to himself. He grabs his daughter’s hand and rushed in a random direction hoping to find something or someone, he came across a sort of big tropical forest, he gasped in excitement. Was this where his god that he believed in might live in?\n“Yay we found something!!” his daughter shouted, she followed her dad into the forest. There he was, the god that seemed to be helpful, relaxing in the middle of the beautiful forest, “shhhh” the dad whispered to his daughter. There were juicy fruits and big clumps of meat and bread just lying around, they started stuffing their mouths with food, jugging fresh juice. “What do you think your doing…” he said softly.\n“Getting what we deserve, you are a selfish, lazy man, you didn’t bother helping us, we where in the middle of nowhere”\n“Still are” the god said “but how dare you insult me” He grabbed Muhammed and his daughter by the neck, he let go of the girl and she smashed her at the grass, she was died…\n“NOOOO” he shouted in pain but then a sword only to be collected by a chosen one flew out of the ground straight into Muhammed’s hand. He shoved the sword right into Momo’s stomach five or six times until he was dead, the hand loosened around Muhammed’s neck. Then Muhammed slowly changed into the now known Killer of gods and had gotten evil, and when I mean evil, I mean really evil he had gotten his revenge so many times but that didn’t satisfy him and he decided to trap over a hundred kids in a cage in the middle of nowhere.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1"}
{"prompt":"The Cage\nOne day there was a boy that wondered about everything around him. He even wondered about the lonely bird in that tiny claustrophobic cage. The bird was very down and needed some food. The boy went to the animal shop close by his house and got a one kilo pack of bird seeds. The thing was that the cage was up in the air and the boy thought to himself \"how in the world am I going to get up there?\" So, the boy left and returned the next day.\n\"Ahhhhhhh what a nice day to go feed the bird.\" so took a ladder and climbed up next to the tree where the bird was hanging. With the bolt cutters he opened the cage and as soon as he did, he the bid started flapping like crazy. The boy nearly fainted because of all the poop the bird had done. It was a whole pile of poop. The boy poured some seeds into the bowl and the bird started eating. \"Luckily I saved it from dying.\" the boy said. When he started leaving the bird finished the bowl of seeds and escaped from the cage and started following the boy where he went. That was back home. When the boy reached his house, he saw the bird sitting on his front porch. he quickly grabbed the cage from the previous bird and caught it. He gave it some water and when it was time for the bird's release it stayed in the cage. The boy was confused. He didn't know what was happening. He called his mother and told her what happened.\nThe next day the boy checked on the bird, and it was still sleeping but that was unusual because the bird was usually awake by 6:30 in the morning! The bird was happy it found an owner and today it slept all the way up to 1:00pm. \"Muuuuuum?\" The boy questioned. But there was no answer. The boy took the bird outside to take some fresh air because he was stuck in his hot and stuffy room. He fed the bird and threw one at it and the bird turned out to be an Olympic Gold medalist.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1"}
{"prompt":"The water of life\nIn a the middle of Zimbabwe lived a tiny town called Binjama with a population of 36 poeple. The weather was always hot and the crops were very hard to grow. The three farmers Hakeem, Abdul and Jaber had the hardest job in town making sure that every crop grew to its maximum size. It was a big struggle but they tried their best to provide for Binjama. The only source of water in Binjama was a pond. Binjama has been living off that pond for decades. Now that pond was shrinking and all the water was expected to run out from two to three weeks. The people were always worried about that but someone by the name of Jimbabwe didn't. After he heard that the water was gone soon he started to make a machine that could potentially give a signal to any country on Earth.\nEven though in Binjama they were short on materials Jimbabwe still mange to make his machine from scrap metal and clay. He had no idea how to send the signal anywhere so he asked his sister, Katrina how to do it. fortunately for Jimbabwe that his sister had read a book about this. As Katrina was looking at the scrap metal and clay that Jimbabwe collected she instantly new what she had to do. During Katrina's construction Jimbabwe was looking at her and had no idea what she was making. Eventually Katrina finished building her mechanism and was ready to put it inside the metal and clay contraption. The device was finally ready but before they could use it someone was calling thier name.\nThey left their room to find out it was thier mum calling them for dinner. They walked to the dinner table ready to eat but realised there wasn't enough food for all three of them. Jimbabwe and Katrina both said to thier mother \" Why isn't there enough food for us?\" Thier mum Replied with \" The farmers aren't able to grow any crops now becuase the water in the pond disappeared.\" They all ate dinner together with a sad face and a worried feeling. Jimbabwe and Katrina know knew that they needed to make the signal device work now. After a few finishing touches Jimbabwe and Katrina now thought to send a signal to somewhere. The both agreed upon sending the signal north-west so The United States could come and save them. They both clicked the button to send the signal and now where waiting for people to save them.\nAfter a day there was no luck, the town were all sitting down in their houses drinking every last drop of water they had. The town was now in a state of depression, they had no more water, no food, were thirsty and starving. But at five o'clock in the morning Jimbabwe heard a wierd sound coming from the sky above. He ran outside and saw three helicopters coming down to save them. As the sound got louder the whole town of Binjama left their houses and were now finally happy that they wouldn't die. When the helicopters parked on the ground the people of Binjama ran to them waiting for the people to come out of the helicopters.  As one of the helicopter doors opened they were all excited to see a man by the name of Mr Apple. He greeted everyone and brought out crates of food and water for the people. The Binjamian People were all jumping up in excitment becuase they were all saved. The food was enough to last the town years. But the town gave all the credit to Jimbabwe and Katrina and gave them the name title of The Saviours. The town was now back to its best like it was all those years ago and was also made it in the american news.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 0 0"}

{"prompt":"The Maze\nThe damp air filled my lungs as I jolted myself awake. Everything was dark and I didn't recognise were I was. Though after sitting up, I notoiced that I was in a dingy hallway. Both ends of this hallway faded into inky darkness, and the walls looked like a Greek marble. The floor was just dirt, but it was firm, likely from being walked all over for a very, very long time.\nMy head felt like it would pop off, and float to the ceiling as the blood rushed to my brain. The pins-and-neadles in my legs, felt like fire ants were biting and crawling under my skin. As I brought up the courage to venture into the darkness, hand on my bronze dagger's sheath, my ears picked up on an ungodly, bellowing roar coming from somewhere close in the labourynth. I picked up the pace, knowing that I would much rather me find it, than it find me.\nAfter sprinting, crawling and stumbling down hallways, around scary traps and pools of scalding hot lava, I felt that my energy had depleted completely and I fell to the ground on my hands and knees. The third, throaty roar sounded closer than usual, as if the thing knew I was here, that or it was just expecting it's dinner from King Minor. Either way, I had to find a way out of here, if one existed. King Minor had this maze built for his own, pure entertainmen. 20 other young men and women were stuck down here with me, just waiting in horror as we were stalked by the fabled Minotor.\nSuddenly, like a bolder smacking me in the head, I realised something. I was lost. King Minor had made the greatest Greek inventor of all time create this shifting maze, and I was going to die down here.\nBut... not if I could find Adrianet's string. My friend knew her before King Minor threw him in here with the others.\nMy pace quickened and the shifting maze's walls rushed past me, shifting from marble, to wood, and the occasional, long dead skeleton wizzed past too. Find the string. Find the string. The thought echoed in my head like a voice in an empty cavern.\nThe fourth throaty roar sounded, but this time was different. Dust and dirt rained from the ceiling as I felt the ground beneath me shake. The narrow hallway I was in opened into a huge, circle, marble room.\nThe fact that the room was circular, and had marble walls was the least of my problems. Towering tall and mighty, stood the Minotor. Fear snatched me up into a choke-hold. The marble walls closed in. Don't panic, if you panic you are an easy target.\nFor those who dont know, the Minotor is an Anchient Greek monster, with the body of an enourmous man, and the head of a bull. The Minotor has a all the sences of a bull, but they are all razor sharp. It was thrown into the Labourynth to kill all the prisoners that King Minor threw in here with it, but sometimes The King just threw random people in here for his own amusment.\nI sliped my dagger out of the shieth even though I knew that if it came to close combat, I would almost certanly be doomed.\n\"Come at me.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 3"}

{"prompt":"The Water Of Life\nIn an underwater life there was known to be a secret kingdom, one that no one had ever seen before except for the mysterious and secretive people who had lived there for centuries. It was known to have a leader one that was very selfish and ungrateful who wanted the kingdom all to himeself. It was the worlds mission to discover this mysterious kingdom and teach the leader a very valuable lesson.\nPeople all over the world knew about this kingdom but no one was ever brave enough to dare to explore it although that was soon to change.\nOne day there was a ship taking tourists from Greece to the UK  and on there journey their ship got caught on something mysterious and unknown under the water. \"We have got cought on something unexpected and it looks like we might have to call another ship to continue your journey\", announced the dissapointed ship driver. As all the passengers where getting off their destoyed and useless boat something caught the eye of one of the passengers named Nick. It looked to him like there was some sort of life under the deep blue ocean. He was like a child who was persistent to get what they wanted but instead he was pesistant to discover what he saw.\nThe next day he hired a jet ski from the nearest place he could find and set of for his mission it took him any long and tiering hours to refind what he saw but once Nick did he was happier than a kid on Christmas day. He then dived into the cold, dirty water and swam straight to the botom where he saw something that looked like an entrance. He swam straight through but was unwantingly greated by the leader. \"What do you think you are doing here Mr. You are not worthy enough to enter my magnificent kinngdom\", shouted the unworthy leader. Nick said nothing and quickly decided to try to enter from the back. It worked and he saw so many marevelous things all kept in prestin condition. He could not believe his eyes. Nick spent hours upon hours exploring the kindgom and he could now say he was the first to ever discover and explore the kingdom that no one ever dared to enter. He felt special and privillaged.\nWhen he arrived back in his home town of greece he eas asked to go on the news and speak about what he had found. \"Today on the four pm news we are going to broadcast to Greece where someone has discovered somethig extrodinary and extremely special\", explained the news reporter. \"What can you tell us about your finding today Nick\", asked the news reporter. \" to be honest with you I am in complete shock i just cant believe that I am the first to discover this magnificent and marvellous kingdom. It is nothing like what you expect it to be\", explained Nick. \"Thanks for speaking with us today said the news reporter gratefully.\nNick was now know as one of the most famous people for discovering something no one ever had dared to even attempt to explore.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1"}
{"prompt":"The doorway\nTravelling in a car isn't fun. Definitely for hours on end. 4 hours and 21 minutes to be exact. Lying down in the backseat, my head dizzy and throat carring vomit. The vomit may be from the bumby gravel and sharp turns, but maybe also from the cockroach infestation in our house. Those beasts posioning our food with ease, even picturing those rodents send another lump down my throat. Either way, the pest controller were sure to 'take care' of it, but in my opinon, the cockroachs should not be 'taken care of', that would a polite gesture after they did their filthy act. My parents are part of the procedure to take care of them, normally my lively and respectable mum would be leading the way to grandmas, making less sharp turns. But, my grandma, also lively and respectable, was driving. Dreaming of cockroaches and posioned rice, I begin to dose off.\nLooming over, the dark brick castle was ready to bite. The temperature dropped as I left my comfortable huddling postion. Wind prickled at my skin, sweeping my brown hair, aggressively pulling it. Great vines seemed to have grown mischieviously between the large, black gate, so much it couldn't be open by the mechanical pulley sytem, they installed only so long ago. \"Sorry dear to wake you,\" My grandma apologised, sweeping her grey locks of hair behind her ear, \"not the best weather today, but I'm sure your stay will be enjoyable.\"\nLifting suitcase, after suitcase, to reality kicked in. This would be my house for the next three weeks. At the most. At least, that's what mum said to comfort me. The suitcases we carried were dropped off in my new room. I've never even moved house before, calling another room 'mine' feels.. off. Cream walls, with a king sized bed, with pillers on all corners, a beautiful drapping fabic connected them. Fluffy and warm carpet, with familiar photos, books and paintings surrounding me. It felt like home. Well, maybe because it always was.\nMy grandma led me through the garden, letting me breath and get less infected air in my system. Her garden seemed effortlessly beautiful, like a over grownfield, atleast that's how big it was anyway. In the back of the garden, was a door. Engraved into the fence, it had flowers and leaves arching over it. The knob on the door was stiff and wooden, hard to the touch.\nI wouldn't rate this day as perfect, nor as even a postive experience. It wasn't negative, I just don't want to be here. That's what I gave as feedback at dinnertime, which my grandma just nodded to. I'm now in the bed, that doesnt have bedbugs, and doesn't have my.. feel to it. But, I just can't get the door out of my head, it feels like a call to me, like it's time to act. It's midnight, and sleeping in a old castle has unfamiliar sounds, the woo'ing and aaah'ing makes it frightening, and confusing in the dark.\nI reached out to my imagination. My.. intrusive thoughts. In my head it seems I'm walking out of th castle. I barely know where the bathroom is, but yet my mind seems to trail onwars into the garden. Opening my eyes I try to shake off the feeling of uncontrolled emotion, uncontrolled.. body. Before, I was on my bed. But now it seems I really am in the garden.\nI'm right infront of the door. I've actually walked the entire way through the castle, just letting something control me. The force controls me again, my hand slowly raises from my side, the tension between my hand and the door in undescribable. My hand touches the handle. My eyes are blinded, I can't see a thing, the light emerges from the door, as if it's... opening? The engraved door on the wall.. is opening. It's not fully opened, but i can still hardly see a thing from the light beaming into my eyes.. Controlled again, I start to step into the doorway.\nThe doorway led to.. somewhere. That's the best way to describe it. I'm not colourblind, but the colours don't look right, I never acknowledged the bright greens, and the deep greys, but everything is wrong. Right now, it's day. The sky is a plain crimson, and the grass a watery blue. After going through the door, I am back in front of it.  This time, I try at the door handle once more, it stays locked and hard.\nScreaming through tears, I find my way to my grandma, in the kitchen, making breakfast. \"I can't see.. I can't see...\"\n\"Of course you can't see through those tears! What's wrong?\" Her face kind and considerate, I begin to explain what had happened, mostly about the door. \"I understand. You see, this castle has a curse. No-one knows where that doors came from, I even stuided history at university, and I hvae no clue of it's origns, everywhere I look.\"\n\"And? Why am I blind!\"\n\"Let me finish. I am also like you, the sky a deep red, and the grass a watery blue. There's no way to reverse it, I can't help you.\"\n\"So I'm stuck like this?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI experience life full of colour, maybe it's not right, but i can see. After three weeks as I was promised, I'm back home. I haven't told my parents, but I'm trying my best to research everything I can. History seems to be my strong suit, and I'm going to fix what that door did. What other curses did it do? How.. old is this door? My mind has already exploded with questions. Tired, and aches all over, I struggle to my bed. My room. Just, not any cochroaches. Waiting for a dream, I start to imagine colour like it was before the doorway.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 3"}
{"prompt":"The Cage\nThe cage maze... It was a maze in a cage. A maze that has claimed the souls of many lone travellers who had been kidnapped by the feroucious fallout crew. They would be put into the cage maze and the first person to find the exit was crowned the winner and was let go, however the losers had to lose something very valuble. Their soul...\nI was one of the many travellers that had been kidnapped by the crew. It was my turn to run the as maze and I had a feeling I wouldnt make it out with a soul. My name was Eddie, Eddie Murphy and when the horn blared I would need to run for my life, no soul...\nAbout 30 seconds later the horn started blaring, when it stopped we could go. The crowd were cheering looking for their athelete. They bet on atheletes before we began. I myself was bet on by two crazy looking brothers, I was going to let them down. I wasn't going to win.\nIt stopped, we ran, the crowd roared. I started to enter some forks in the road. \"Which way, which way!?\" I franttically asked myself. I decided to go right because right is right, right? Anyway as I went right I saw a vile creature, the Wraith. It had a adventurer in its shadowy grasp and caried him away into a different part of the maze. Oh I didn't tell you about the creatures well now you know.\nI decided to keep right from my saying (right is always right right?) and kept making a steady pace avoiding any right turns that I heard a shriek in. and kept movind when i saw another person being dragged off into  bush. he begged and begged and begged to me to help him. I was about but no i couldnt be sidetracked by others. I needed to get out I couldn't help someone reach glory and i lose my soul, so I continued with my everlong journey through the cage maze.\nJust then I heard a shout it was the brothers ''Go left!'' one shouted to me. I decided to trust them because they had betted on me. and sure enough it was safe, for now...\nI started losing hope ''Someone probably already found the exit.'' I muttered but then my soul would be sucked out by the wraiths by now. Just as I turned right I saw it... The exit. It was there sitting in all its glory> I started spriting away into the outside land but then the hedge just closed of the exit ''WHAT!\" I shouted \"HOW!\" I screamed. It was discouraging, very discouraging to see the finish line and just then see it dissapear again.\nBut then it reapeared in front of him this time he ran through and the horns blared one final time... He had won he had made it. when he thought he was free, three armed fallout crew members escorted him to the leader. When they reachjed the leader asked him a single question ''Since you won would you like to join the fallout crew?'' he asked '' Yes'' I replied...\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1"}
{"prompt":"The maze.\nTom wakes up and looks around, its like he is in a lush rain forest deep in the amazon but he is only half awake once he gets up he realizes the dark green is just a hedge. As Tom walks around he realizes he is in a maze after a bit he starts to speed up turning random corners frantickly looking for the exit but he startsseeing the same courners. 'I dont know what kid of sick joke you are playing but you better let me out!' Tom cried. After what must've been an hour he sat down in a ball his emotions taking over tears started to fall turning the dry ground damp. Then to make things worse it started to rain. Tom got to his boiling point punching the ground and trying to get through the hedge but this force was pushing him back. He felt like he was in a cage and was never going to be let out.\nOnce he gets up the sky is a mixed color of violet and blue as if there was a buitiful sunset. In the distance he can hear a clicking noise but he just ignores it.\nAfter a while the sky is navy blue and the clicking is getting louder as if something is getting closer and closer and closer, Tom picks up the pace making sure to look before every corner he trys to get through the Hedge but he just gets pushed away like before. The clicking is getting so close, Tom turns a corner and then he sees it but it doesnt see him its face is only white with black patches where its eyes and mouth would be. It has arms longer than its legs with claws the size on daggers and it has no hair. Suddenly it turns its head as if it was looking strait at him dead in the eye. Tom can't move he is frozen, the color has drained from his face and sweat drips down from his hair. It starts running towards him using its hands while running just as a gorilla would. Tom starts to sprint screaming along the way he doesnt understand, 'first I wake up in a maze now this unnatural being' he shreaks. Tom hears gun shots in the distance and people yelling he turns a couple more corners and starts screaming ' over here over here' he assumes they can hear him because he hears thumping on the ground coing towards him or maybe thats just another one of these monsters. As he turns a courner he finds people dressed in loads of different guns and body armor. They shoot at the monster and then bring Tom back to there shelter.\nAfter a great nights sleep Tom learns that the monsters are called arm jackers, they use their clicking to get around as they dont have any eyes and they only come out at night. Tom asks of the tribe has ever tryed to escape but they say no 'every time somone trys to escape they allways say they will be back before dark but they never come back so we assume they are dead' says one of the older people. 'Every night the maze hedges change' Says the only surviver that has made it through the night.\nAt midday Tom eats lines up for lunch the flavours melt in his his mouth it is so good he has to sit down\nNear the end of the day Tom grabs a gun and boddy armor he is thinking about escaping 'it cant be that bad can it, i just can't run out of ammo.'Tom starts to pack a back pack he asks one of the cheffs for some food the cheff say he shouldnt go but if he does he better have food that lasts. Tom decided that he should go in the morning strait after dusk.\nIn the morning he sets off, he turns all sorts of courners right, left and around Tom gets out a meal made by one of the cheffs. He knows he can't sit down other wise he wont get far enough before the arm jackers come out.\nOnce the sky turns that violet orange he starts to hear the clicking but Tom just keeps the same pace. Once he finds an arm jacker he realises that there are to many but he has allready given his cover away but for some reason they don't chase him they just turn a courner. Tom starts to folllow them then they turn around but the strangest thing happens it says hello, Tom asks them why they arent chassing the arm jacker says they used to be humans but they stayed in the maze for to long and never got to return back to the shelter and when they did try to the  people tryed to kill us because they thought we were tring to kill them which is fair to be honest. But hey do you want us to show you the way out Tom thinks about it, 'yes please.'\nHe starts following them and once he sees the way out he shout with joy 'thank you thank you thank you!' Once he gets out he runs to the city catches a taxy to his house but then he realizes its not their then he sees adds for the Ollimpics 2060. Its been 57 years!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 1"}
