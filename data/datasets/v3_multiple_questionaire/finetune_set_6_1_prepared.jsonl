{"prompt":"The Cage\nThis was the city of Cage, where everything other than humans were trapped in cages for most of the time, the cows were in cages with 2 cows in one cage. The sheep and pigs were the same. Even the man's best friend, dogs, were trapped in cages. Don't ask me why, it was because of what happened here long, long, ago...\n136 years ago\nIt was a sunny and joyful place all those years ago. The air smelled of a fresh spring. The florist giving free flowers to anyone who walked by. The cows mooed happily as they munched on grass. The sound of singing fill the air. The citizens were celebrating the good fortune of harvest they had. They had enough crops to feed themselves and the animals, who were all free roaming around town. Every week, the butcher would hunt down one animal for the small town, making a delicious feast from it. This week was pig, so all the citizens went to bed that night dreaming about bacon and ham.\nThe next morning was a dull day, as soon as the first of the citizens wake up though, the sky became bright blue. The trees danced happily in the light wind. There was one problem, the place was as silent as, well, nothing. There was no mooing, no oinking. Where was everything? They looked around, no animals to be seen.\nSuddenly a lady screamed,' the crop shed door is open!' All the citizens gathered around the shed faster than you could say pigs. The butcher slowly walked in and saw a terrible sight. The animals were munching down all the crops! 'We're doomed!' wailed a young girl. A young man about the age of 19 had an idea though, to trap the animals into paddocks. So they did. It was ingenious. That kept the animals from eating all the crops, for 76 years...\nIt was a beautiful day. The young man was now so old he could not even leave his house, but he was still celebrated as a savior. His house was all rusty, his photos were all covered in dust. This is the part when we get back to the cages, right about when the animals break out of the fences. Crash! The fences broke. After a brief meeting, they decided to go to the old man for help. He said after a while,' Maybe put them in metal cages, throw grass to them for feeding.' It was a success! The animals couldn't break through. The next day, the man passed away. The whole town grieved.\nPresent day\nClaudia, a young girl, rushed through the streets, all the way to the alley full of animal cages. Discreetly, she fed all of them, even the ones dangling from high above. 'I will get you out one day,' she whispered the the animals. She spent all her free time working on an early version of metal cutters. It was a very difficult job, but she managed to create one. Now she just needed a place to keep them.\nClaudia resented the animals kept in cages, she resented he great-grandfather for the idea of trapping them. The anger burned her skin. For some reason, the animals were veryh obedient to her, so she freed all the animals and told them to stay in the alley. She then took all the cages and made a fence-like shape. Next, she placed all the metal fences around where the wooden fences used to be, and took the animals into the pen. The citizens all were very angry about this, but once they saw that it was very impossible for the animals to get out, they cheered wildly, and had a celebration. That was the end of the cages, and animal cruelty in this town.\nNow, you may be wondering what about the dogs. If not, I'll tell you anyway. It was simple, most of them were adopted, but the few that weren't adopted, were trained by Claudia to guard the animals from a new threat, foxes and wolves. Now this is the end of this story.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 2 3 3 2 3\n"}
{"prompt":"The Maze\nNo-one was fooled by the clear sky and the bright sun. In Athens, the worst day of the decade was coming. The high king, Papo, saw from his castle a ship bearing the flag of Crete. He saw the seven children tributes lining up at the docks. They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo's son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him. All the other tributes accepted their fates, but he wouldn't. \"Play it cool,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can escape The Maze. If I kill the beast that awaits us there, I can live as I have always lived in Athens.\" The boats arrived, took the tributes hostage, and sailed away to the worst island in the world.\nOnce Bellapapo and the other tributes landed in Crete, the king, Minos, took them in for a celebratory feast on his castle. He announced that if the tributes survived the beast, they would go home with 10 ass-loads of gold. (Ass being a donkey, what did you think it meant)? The castle sat on a big hill, which was surronded by water. Bellapapo had an idea. \"If this guy thinks I am the son of a god, he will be reluctant to send me in.\" After the main course had been delivered, Bellapapo claimed \"I am the son of Posieden, god of the sea. If you dare put a demigod in The Maze, you shall feel the wrath of Posiedon!\"\n\"Well, son of Posiedon,\" Drawled Minos, king of Crete,\" I am glad to host you. But you are a son of the SECOND most powerful god and from the SECOND most powerful city. I am the son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and rule the most powerful CITY!\" He screamed the last word, and as he did so, his ring flew out the window. Bellapapo, being ADHD and looking for something to do, ran and jumped out the window. King Minos thought: \"Ah well. We can do the trials with six kids.\" Meanwhile, Bellapapo was praying to Posiedon to save his neck. He noticed the waves were moving awkwardly. Suddenly, a wave lashed out of the water and coiled around Bellapapo like a snake, then tossed him to shore. He shrugged his shoulders, muttered a prayer to Posieden and truged up the hill back to the castle\n\"Into the maze, the time is now.  You cannot live there's no way out.  Into the maze and to the beast. That will rip you with all his teeth. Into the maze, and to your death. For the trouble that you parents made.\"\nThe locals were pumped that it was that time of year again. The weather was rainy, but they were taken aback when, unlike the usually cowards that they brought from Athens, one of the tributes seemed to be enjoying the attention. King Minos announced \"LET THE 3RD MAZE TRIALS, BEGIN!\" The tributes were thrown into the maze. Bellapapo told the tributes to hold onto a piece of string while he went searching for the beast. It didn't take long. He found the beast at an intersection between somewhere and something. From the waist down it was human. From the waist up, it was a bull.\n\"RAWR!\" Roared the beast. \"RAWR!\" Roared Bellapapo. The beast charged, trying to catch Bellapapo off guard. Bellapapo sidestepped and hooked the beast in the snout. The beast didn't seem fazed by it. He was used to pain. Those whips they used on him hurt more than anything else. Bellapapo kept on counter-attacking the beast, but it didn't seem to get injured or tired. Bellapapo tried a different approach. He ran at the beast, jumped on its back and ripped off his right tusk. \"RAWR!\" Bellowed the beast. Bellapapo didn't stop there. The clouds parted and the sun shone, a rainbow appeared as Bellapapo brought the tusk down onto the beasts head, killing it instantly.\nCrete, Athens, Greece and the world was shocked. It wasn't everyday you saw a mutant bull die to his own tusk. It probably would be put on 9news. Sadly, there were no TVs then. Bellapapo and the other tributes rejoiced of their freedom and hey, who doesn't want ten ass-loads of gold shipped to your kingdom. (Again, an ass is a donkey). Bellapapo was elected the general fo the Athenian army, and his first campain was against Crete. Seeing as most of Crete hated Minos, they didn't bother stopping him from taking over the country. And so, I'd like to say that they lived a long and happy life. Sadly, Minos faked his death. In reality, he was alive, and he sat with his most trusted advisors, plotting Bellapapo's demise.\nTO BE CONTINUED\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 3 3 3\n"}
{"prompt":"The Cage\nIt was a dark cold morning. The clouds blew across the sky above an old, brown house on a big, tall hill. Inside that house was a little cage that was glinting in the light of the car's headlights that were currently driving past. Inside that cage, there was a little bird. This bird had lived in this cage it's whole entire life, but that bird did not like living in that cage. It was always very sad. The sound of silence was pleasing, until the Bird woke.\n\"Ough!!\" I yawned as I got out of bed. I flapped as I stood up, my yellow feathers shining, like daisy's in a paddock.\n\"Oh, come on!! Why do I have to be the only bird in the world stuck in this TINY little cage!!!\" I complained as I stamped my foot on the water bowl, making the water tip out, all over the floor.\n\"It is time that I finally got out of this cage!!!\" I yelled. \"I must make a plan! I'm sick of this!\"\n20 minutes later, I had brainstormed 5 possible ways to get out of cage.\n\"Okay, plan number 1: Noise.\" I said to myself.\nI jumped up onto the edge of the cage, squawking as loud as I could. 5 seconds later, the dreaded woman came up to me, and I kept squawking. She mumbled something unintelligable and walked off.\n\"Plan number 1 didn't work, so let's try plan number 2: Wire cutting.\" I exclaimed.\nSharpening my beak on the water bowl, I started to gnaw on the wires on the side of the grey cage. I tried my hardest, however I just couldn't do it. They were too thick.\n\"Okay, time to proceed to plan number 3: Worm impersonating.\nDigging throught the dirt, I discovered that ther was plastic underneath me.\n\"Great. Another failed plan.\" I thought to myself.\nTime to proceed to the 4th plan: Playing dead.\nI started squawking really loudly, but as the woman came to see me again, I jumped onto the ground and lay there still. She mumbled something again, and opened the cage door. I took my chance, and flew out, into the kitchen. She ran at me, however I was too quick. I jumped down and hopped out an open window, straight into a bin. I quickly scrambled out, and flew off. I was free! I couldn't beleive it! I flew around and found some food. I was finally happy from that day on.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 3 3 3 3 3\n"}

Standing up, she reached out to touch the wall, it slowly moved away from her. Pulling her hand away she stood looking around herself, there were a few paths one to the right one to the left and one directly in front of her. Stepping forward she glanced at the floor, it was dipping below her as she stepped.\nShe muttered to herself, \"This could not, get any stranger.\"\nMoving quickly she strode through the path in front of her, hoping it was the way out.\nAfter traveling for some time, left and right, right and left, she found a small hunched over figure. Beginning to feel desperate, she tapped on its shoulder. Its span around,\n\"what is it?\" the thing mumbled.\n\"well,\" She baegan,\"I thought you may be able to help me? I was wondering if you knew the way out?\"\nThe thing looked up, she stepped back, drawing her hands to her chest, eyes growinf bigger, she was face to face with herself. Except this version of her had glistening eyes, and red a red nose, as if it had been rubbed too many times.\n\"I don't know the way out. This is a maze, just like you I have been searching.,\" the being admitted.\"If I did I would tell you.\" The mirror of her sat down and began to sob.\nBut by then she was off running away from the creature that looked so much like she did.\nSlowing down, the girl collapsed on the floor exhausted. She thought over what the being had said, thining to herself, \"if this is a maze then i just need to find a way out, right?\"\nShe stood up thinking that if she tried har enough she would find her way out, but only after walking a little bit, she began to hear a noise, a muttering. As the speaking grew closer she stopped where she was, soon another version of her appeared, this one was frail and skinny, it was crawling around on the floor, whispering to itself,\n\"Incy wincy spider climbed up the water spout, down came the rain, and washed poor incy out, then up came the sunshine and dried out all the rain, and incy wincy spider will never walk again.\"\nShe was frozen in fear as the thing went past, it began to hum the tun for the song. After it passed she sighed in relief. Then she heard one last sentance from that terrible, creature,\n\"Look up.\"\nShe dashed away, not daring to look up, for fear that the being might be there, after she got tired she stopped, as she was bent over catching her breath, she looked up. The sky was there, she smiled, glad to have found something normal in this strange world. As she looked into the sky she felt droplets falling onto her face, opening her mouth she spun around. When she stopped, lightning struck and she noticed a tower, with stairs, realising this could her her escape she began making her way towards it.\nAs she reached the bottom of the tower, she looked up all the stairs, and began to climb. As she climbed, shadows began to apear in front of her, mimicking her shape and becoming different. She kept running up the stairs, there was the teary eyed one, the frail one, there was even one that was smiled at her, with dead eyes. Knowing they wern't real she ran through them and as they touched her, they where sucked into her heart. When she eventually reached the top her heart was heavy and full. As she looked over the edge of the tower She could see no exit, no ladder, no way out, then her heart full of all the monsters dragged her down, off the tower.\nShe woke up, in her bed, the sheets had fallen off, she had tears on her nose. It was all a dream, she sat there thinking about it.\nFinally realising the maze, and everything in it, was her mind.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 2 2 1 2 2\n"}

{"prompt":"The Maze\nFlickereing neon lights iluminate the dark alleyway that I call home. It's small and cramped, but its the best that you can get in this city. Rain pours down on the plastic roof as i watch a family of rats scurry down the street. The city is a relic of the past, standing the test of time when others fell, but it is still not what it used to be. People living off the streets, scavenging for any little scraps of the rotten food they can find. I've heard rumers about what its like outside of the city and it sounds amazing. lush green feilds stretching as far as the eye can see. clear blue skys, unlike the dark poluted one inside the city. many people have tried and failed to escape. the city is like a maze, once you start moving, you will never find your way back. A squadren of heavily armoured soldiers march down the street, moving in unisen.  Their meant to protect us, but most of the time end up doing the oposite. I feel feet steping on my small hut, breaking through the thin layer of plastic that was protecting me from the elements. I have had enough with the soldiers abusing the less fortunate citizens. I catch one of them off gaurd when I reach out and rip one of thier guns from it's holster. Dashing through the streets, I know they wont be able to follow with the bits of scrap metal poorly atached to their clothes. I start to realise, I will never be able to find my way back to my shelter. I have been living ther for 16 years! how could I just abandon my entier life, where I was born and raised? I find another small alleyway and and run towards it. It's just now that I realise the size of what I just did. there is now way that I could resume my old life, its completly gone. The rain beats down on my skin as I fall into sleep.\nThe world flutters in and out of vision, as I slowly regain consiosness. In my drowzy state, I make a plan. It might not be the best one, but it's the only thing that I can think of. Gathering all the materials will be hard, but it will be worht it. The amount of food that I will need to keep me alive during my journey will be alot to find on the streets, but a couple trash piles should hold enough to keep me alive. The rain has stoped, wich means I can start my esacpe. slung over my shoulder is a small trash bag filled with everything I will need to survive. Food, Water and a blanket for warmth. I make my way through the winding walls of the city, trying to always go away from the central tower. Im looking down at the ground, when I bump into something. whiping my head up, I see a full squadren of soldiurs, betting on two rats fighting. One of them hears me and alerts the others. panic rising, Im frozen in place. The sound of a gun fiering snaps me out of it, but its to late. The bullet whent right through my leg. blood gushes out of the wound. I limp away as fast as I can, hearing the group go back to their game knowing I will die before from blood loss. The blanket I packed serves as a bandage, lessening the flow, but not enough to keep me concious. I strugle to stay awake, but its no use. I once again fall into a deep sleep\nThe blood must have clotted at the wound, because I wake up again. its brighter, signiling that I have been asleep for at least a day. I check up on the bandage. soaked in blood, just like I thought. The pain is bearable though, so I start making my way through the city again, making shure im carefull around more densly opulated areas. After days of wandering, my food storage starts to run low. I try to keep up my normal pace, but my starving body forces me to go slower. Im eating my last scrap of food, making the most of the it. All hope seems lost, my food and water suplies have been depleted, and I dont even know if I have made progress. Lightheaded and starving, I reach a dead end. I slump against the cold wall, waiting for death to come, but the wall behind me starts to shift. I fall back and see sunlight filtering through the leaves. Leaves! I have found my way out. Mustering all the energy I can, I run towards The tree, but when I reach it, something seems wrong. The tree disapears and I realise, I havnt found my way out. The walls are still around me, and I know I cant do anyhting to help, so I lay down, and Ebracing my last moments in this cruel world, and fade into the dark abyss of death.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 3 3 2\n"}

Jake walked in first as the others followed closely behind, he noticed the front desk was deserted and a mess. Then, a small particular red circle had caught Larry's attention as he put his finger on it. Blood. \"OH MY- Theres, THERE'S BLOOD!\"\n\"Where?\" Robert questioned as he moved towards the desk, \"Oh my god-\"\n\"What!?\" Larry whispered\n\"Loo- Look under the- the desk\" Robert replied as his face turned pale, and what lay on the floor under the desk was the receptionist, he lay there, rigid and still, as if he was dead. He was dead. Dead. Larry and Robert looked at each other, both with white faces speechless, and that's when a thought came through Robert's mind. \"Wait, where's Jake!?\"\n\"What do you mean he's right behin-\" Larry stared as he saw a man behind obert, a black hood and brown coat with some dusty boots. Robert looked behind himself... \"ARGGHHH-\"\n\"Wake up! Wake up! Robert! THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE DOSING OFF! Jake screamed as he shook Roberts frail body. \"HUH!? WHAT- WHAT HAPPEND!?

But most importantly, where ARE we!?\" Jake replied as he looked around the green bushes, triple Jakes height. \"Let's try and find Larry!\" Jake said\n\" How!?\" Robert whispered\n\"Lets just look around, maybe we might get luck-\" \"CRACK CRACK BOOM\" \"WHAT was THAT!?

It's gonna be night soon, we better find a way out of this place.\" Jake whined as a small bit of rain driped down from Jakes face. He looked to his side and Robert was no more. What was just a mere halucination as Robert had been long gone, when Jake made it out of the pillar, Robert wasn't so lucky. Jake dropped down to the ground and started screaming and yelling, gallons of water came down from his face as his eyes shut.\n\"A newcomer, must be, no other people would be in this hell hole\" A man boy said as they loaded Jakes body onto wheelcart. Jakes eyes were squinting, wanting more rest as he forced them open, but it was to much. He closed his eyes, not caring about anything in the world that he had let his friend perish...\nSuddenly, Jake awoke to a bustling village with many people walking around the busy market streets, Jake lay in a bed which funnily enough was outside the house. He got up and looked about as a tall boy with a brown ripped shirt, \"looks like your awake, how do you feel\" the boy asked\n\"Fine thank you, where am I?\" Jake croaked as he saw many kids running around the street.\n\"You are in the west village kiddo, must've been rough losing your friend. Jake hadn't replied as he remembered every moment vividly. \" Oh... uhm, sorry, my name is Khan, there was another newcomer to, do you know him? His name is Larry Choke?\"\n\"Larry? Yeah I know him!\" Jakes sprits were raised a bit as he finally found Larry and got up and ran towards a small house, suddenly he froze. \"Where is he?\"\n\"Hahaha, your a funny guy! So I assume you are close to him?\" Khan asked\n\"Yes, we were friends since kindergarten, where is he?\" Jake replied\n\"Over in that small house, you knew where he was up in there!\" Khan said as he pointed towards Jakes head, Jake said a quick thanks and sprinted towards the house as Khan retreated into the house muttering \"fool.\"\n\"Larryyy! Larry! Larry? Helloooo!\" Jake shouted, something was off, the place was so dusty he could barely breath as he coughed, Jake walked around as the floorboards screamed in agony. Suddenly, a hand grabbed Jake into the wall and took out a pocket knife \"AARGH!\" Jake screamed as he kicked the dark figure into the wooden wall, the wall cracked as Jake came in for a punch, the figure dodged swiftly and side-stepped and kicked Jake in the stomach, James quickly backed away as his eyes told the mysterious person that Jake had really felt that kick. \"Who ARE YOU!? WHat do you want!?\" Jake questioned\n\"I want- I want? I need\" The dark figure whispered as he went in for the finishing blow he grappled Jakes shoulder and twirsted his arm as he whispered \" I will make it quick.\" The figure elbowed Jakes right arm as Jake screamed in pain \"AGHHHH\" cursing under his mouth, then Jake side- flipped kicking the figure in the jaw as a few drips of blood flew out, \" I haven't hunted for days!\" The mysterious preon yelled as he dashed towards jake, Jake dodged as he went for a left punch, his right arm unable to move. The figure caught his arm and threw Jake down to the floor, he took off his hood revealing his face, Larry. \"Larry!? WHY!?\" Jake yelled\n\"No questions\" Larry smiled with a grin and that was the last thing Jake had heard, he closed his eyes, tears running down his face as he wanted to see his mum, he knew he would join his dad but he mostly wanted to see his little baby brother who was still so young, still an infant.\nSuddenly, Jakes right arm had recovered somehow and came in for a right hook towards Larry's cheek as it him him, Larry's entire body ragdolled and was flung across the entire house as Jakes eyes glowed.

As I was walking I could hear all the kids screming! My house was on the end of a small court, it was new we had just moved in it was all mid centery modern, my mum was an interior designer and my dad was an exterior designer. There both have really good taste. I started crossing the busy road that I allways did when a car sped through the red lights right into me I fell to the ground not feeling my body, I couldn't breath!\nWhat feels like days later I opened my eyes to bright lights and people hovered over my head like zombies, I got quite a fright! I could see someone comming towards me I diddn't know who. They came rushing over and saying 'oh you're awake honey,' and hugged me really tight! I asked them, 'who are you?' Everyone who was there seemed quite confused.  I felt like I was in a mental maze, who are these people where am I? I stayed in a bright light room for weeks. Then one morning I woke up to a dreary black room the certains that lined the windows where a musty pink colour that my mum hated and the bed felt like it was going to collapse and leave me on the floor. Luccily I only stayed there for a bit.\nI felt someone pushing my bed down the dreary hallway then I was put into a black car. With the person that said 'oh honey,' to me. We drove for ages I think I fell asllep becuase when i woke up I was in a new bed and something was licking my face, I couldn't imagine what it was but I opened my eyes to see a puppy all furry and cute, and two people standing at the door. I tried to get out of bed the puppy helped me. I walked very slowly the puppy led me to a small courtyard, I sat down while it layed on top of me. I could feel the warm furyness rubbing against me.\nMe and the puppy who I called Rufus walked out to the small garden everyday. Then one day he was running around. I still diddnt have strength and I couldn't remember anything but i got up slowly and did a small jog. At that pont I could remember one thing that I had a bedroom. Islowly had Rufu's help up the stairs I saw a bed and layed down. I moved along in the mental maze! I just need to remember more I thought to myself as I stared out the skylight. Slowly one day after another Rufu's helped me do more. Remember more. One day I even bounced on a trampoline. I just still couldnt remember where I am, Who I am, who are the strange people and how did I end up here?\nOne day Rufu's led me to the stange people they gave me hugs. They ran around the backyard with me they baked cookies with me they had fun with me. It all came back to me all the memories all the people all the friends and family I have.  I started to remember at that point who those people were. They where my Parents! I joggged over to them at the doorway and gave them a huge hug! I was out I was out of the maze! I did it! For days they where rining people and setting up therapy for me, and helped me. All thanks to my four leggered pal Rufus!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 2 2 2 2 2\n"}
{"prompt":"topic:the cage\nI dont know how long ive been here, its always dark. My eyes have gotten used to it, the sight of people in agony.\nWe are just trying to figure out why we are here. It smelled like metal. The last time i spoke with Jessie, which i dont know the time of,\nall we said to each other was \"when do we get out\" and \"why am i here\". Everyone here has been wondering that,\nand the truth is i dont know if i will get out. People who i knew well are now screaming loudly,\nand people who are usually quiet are screaming telling people to be quiet. Its not fun, I didnt get any sleep last\nnight because of the sound of people banging on their cages. Hovering above death, looking it in the eye,\nand then getting put back down, but today I got what i thought was good news. We are getting let out of our iron cages.\nBut not to go back home, the man wore a white smiley mask, he had a suit on with a blue tie, and black gloves.\nHe told us why we were here. \"The real reason why you all are here, is for my experiment. You are all dead. You are\nall well aware that deaths wrath has brought you down. Fortunately for you all, you have been selected for my\nlittle puzzle. im sure you all want redemption and i am conscious of your measures for a second chance. That is why\nthis isnt easy. But, since you arent supposed to be here in the first place, you will do anything, isnt that\nright?\" A few people nodded, i was one of them. I looked Summer in the eye, who looked more depressed than a kid\noutside freezing in a misty morning winter. But i dont care about that. We always had a grudge, but she took it\none step too far. Im not sure if she intentionally pushed me onto that road, getting me run over. Maybe she wasnt\naware there was a car there, but i somehow doubt that. When we were let out of our cage, i ignored her.\n\"So, congratulations. Lets not waste any time, shall we?\"\n\"The first game is simple, you will roll a dice, the highest number moves on. i will pair you all up.\"\nI was paired up with summer, and I wasnt complaining. Finally, my chance to do what she did to me. We didnt say\nanything to each other, we rolled a dice, and i had the highest number. I watched her slowly fade away, becoming the dim that surrounded us.\nThen there were 6 of us, and shadows started creeping around the place. like skeletons. \"For the next one, there are 2 tunnels, only one is safe.\"\nI went through the second tunnel with jessie, and it was very cavey, Sunless and unlit. A cross eyed figure stared at me, it looked more and more like me\nas i edged closer. It let out a loud scream and i realised i went through the wrong tunnel. It ran towards me, a blank expression on its face, its arms\nwere ragdolled and facing straight down. It ran towards me like a zombie, and me and jessie darted around the place, we didnt care where anything lead, we\nwere just rushing around the place. \"come on, just a little more.\"And then i realised i was grabbing a limb. I grabbed 2 barrels i found, and used them as leverage. I stared at the different form of myself, looking it in\nthe eye. I was on my own. I grabbed the barrel, hopped in and accidentally rolled into some water.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 2 2 3 1 1\n"}

The exact location of the wormhole has not been found but stay safe as no one knows the danger the world could experience. I ignored it thinking it wouldn't be a big deal but the I heard a loud horrible screech coming from the sky. As I looked out I saw a large cage with a gruesome bulging eye attached to it.

It was a far fall but it was my only choice. *Aaaaaaah* The horrid stench of the garbage sneaked into my nose as I felt my leg bleed. I ducked my head under the dumpster for a few hours until I decided to see if it was still there. It looked as if I was in a barren desert in Africa. The red sand burned my feet as I ran across the desert trying to find people. I was about to kick the bucket until I fell into the ground. As I opened my eyes I was blinded by the lights. A man wearing a surgical eyes and skin more pale than the snow was playing with me eyelids seeing if I was alive. I shrieked and hopped off the bed. I was so scared if felt as my skin came off. He said he was checking if I was still alive.\nHe explained that he found a way to get rid of the CAGE by shooting highly concentrated plutonium missile at it. It would burn it in a second. Unfortunately he was too old to operate the machine and asked if I could do it. I agreed as there would be no other way to save the world.I could feel the heat from the missile emitting off my skin. I aimed at the cornea of the CAGE as my hands trembled. I knew that if I made a mistake it would be game over for the world. *3 *2 *1... *Pssssssst. The missile whistled in the air as it flew at the CAGE. A second later i saw it. The CAGE was melting away while shrieking in pain. I did it. I SAVED THE WORLD.\n6 YEARS LATER...\nIt has been a few years now and the world is still healing.

This brings us to today, a very important moment of ronans career.\n\"CLUNK,\" Ronan dropped all of his diving gear into the back of his pink, rickety Toyota Yaris that he has had for 10 years. The car sags down with all the weight, it smelt of the sea and it was barely alive but he still loved it. the engine starts and he drives off with all the gear rattling around in the back, its a decently long drive, maybe 2 hours or so but Ronan is excited all the way.\nThe car stops at a halt and Ronan gets out of the car as if he has only been in the car for 5 minutes, he is greeted by two British men with brown and grey beards and round glasses, they looked like brothers, they shake hands and introduce themselves, the men are both divers and marine bioligists. As Ronan is getting his wetsuit on he shows them a satellite image of the site they will be going to, to an untrained eye it just looks like an ordinary birds eye view picture of the ocean but to them its much more significant, the most vague outlines of a temple can be seen through the deep blue ocean that hides it, it looks promisimg but there is only one way to find out.\nRonan finishes changing and the men lead him over to the boat, it isn't a mssive industrial one but he was happy about that, he found that it was more comfortable to dive off small boats because the bigger ones were just daunting. The boat was white and it looked fresh.\nThey all got onto the boat and Ronan typed in the coardinates, they started the engine and set sail for a 45 minute trip on the water. \"We're here!\" One of the men shouted with the energy of a an 8 year old, Ronan gathered himself and his gear. Once all of them are suited  up they sit on the edge of the boat with their backs to the water, Ronan looks back the water is as clear as glass and as calm as day, he is praying for this\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 2 2 2 2 1\n"}
{"prompt":"The water of life\n“Dad wake up!” she yelled while pounding on his chest “please” she yelled again.\nHe finally woke up, the girl stopped sobbing as she heard him get up. “Where are we” he shouted in confusion, “I don’t know” the girl sobbed. The father started praying and he seemed to as said “Momos” (the god of help) “please answer our call we are begging you, me and my daughter have been teleported to an unknown place, please bring us back to earth” he moaned. And nothing, two whole hours went by, no water, no food, nothing. Muhammed (the dads name) yelled in anger “I knew he wasn’t able to help” he said to himself. He grabs his daughter’s hand and rushed in a random direction hoping to find something or someone, he came across a sort of big tropical forest, he gasped in excitement. Was this where his god that he believed in might live in?\n“Yay we found something!!” his daughter shouted, she followed her dad into the forest. There he was, the god that seemed to be helpful, relaxing in the middle of the beautiful forest, “shhhh” the dad whispered to his daughter. There were juicy fruits and big clumps of meat and bread just lying around, they started stuffing their mouths with food, jugging fresh juice. “What do you think your doing…” he said softly.\n“Getting what we deserve, you are a selfish, lazy man, you didn’t bother helping us, we where in the middle of nowhere”\n“Still are” the god said “but how dare you insult me” He grabbed Muhammed and his daughter by the neck, he let go of the girl and she smashed her at the grass, she was died…\n“NOOOO” he shouted in pain but then a sword only to be collected by a chosen one flew out of the ground straight into Muhammed’s hand. He shoved the sword right into Momo’s stomach five or six times until he was dead, the hand loosened around Muhammed’s neck. Then Muhammed slowly changed into the now known Killer of gods and had gotten evil, and when I mean evil, I mean really evil he had gotten his revenge so many times but that didn’t satisfy him and he decided to trap over a hundred kids in a cage in the middle of nowhere.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1 1 2 2 1\n"}

{"prompt":"The Cage\nOne day there was a boy that wondered about everything around him. He even wondered about the lonely bird in that tiny claustrophobic cage. The bird was very down and needed some food. The boy went to the animal shop close by his house and got a one kilo pack of bird seeds. The thing was that the cage was up in the air and the boy thought to himself \"how in the world am I going to get up there?\" So, the boy left and returned the next day.\n\"Ahhhhhhh what a nice day to go feed the bird.\" so took a ladder and climbed up next to the tree where the bird was hanging. With the bolt cutters he opened the cage and as soon as he did, he the bid started flapping like crazy. The boy nearly fainted because of all the poop the bird had done. It was a whole pile of poop. The boy poured some seeds into the bowl and the bird started eating. \"Luckily I saved it from dying.\" the boy said. When he started leaving the bird finished the bowl of seeds and escaped from the cage and started following the boy where he went. That was back home. When the boy reached his house, he saw the bird sitting on his front porch. he quickly grabbed the cage from the previous bird and caught it. He gave it some water and when it was time for the bird's release it stayed in the cage. The boy was confused. He didn't know what was happening. He called his mother and told her what happened.\nThe next day the boy checked on the bird, and it was still sleeping but that was unusual because the bird was usually awake by 6:30 in the morning! The bird was happy it found an owner and today it slept all the way up to 1:00pm. \"Muuuuuum?\" The boy questioned. But there was no answer. The boy took the bird outside to take some fresh air because he was stuck in his hot and stuffy room. He fed the bird and threw one at it and the bird turned out to be an Olympic Gold medalist.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1 1 1 1 1\n"}

The best way to could describe Tom, would be calling the sterotypical cowboy. With his thick bush beard. As well as ragged clothes that look like they would cut you if you touched them. Tom had a wife called  Jennifer. \"Well dont be so quick to your gun.\" She exclaimed fully knowing he wasnt talking to her.\nJennifer was the only one that could understand him clearly. \"We still need to book the plane tickets.\"So they did. they booked the first ones they could get. And then they drove to the airport while sitting on their soft leather seats. And  Jennifer gasping when she saw the price. You could almost see the steam piping out of her ears. But never less they went on and hopped on the luxouirce plane, that smelled like lavander and honey. \"This is first time I'v gone in first class.\" Jennifer thought to herself. And she kind of liked it. When they arrived they got to get off on a red carpet. \"This is luxory.\"She said out loud. Then instanly regreted it because a bunch of australian\/suicidal flys flew into her mouth. \"Of to find the door.\" she said. After she recovered from the attack. And of they went they got a taxi. Then walked for a little bit through the crowds of people wearing hats. They finally made it. \"Well this is it.\" they both said and went through. What they saw on the otherside is impossible to explain all that can be said is they felt like they were falling. And that there was bilions of human, dog, cat ,rabbit skulls and skelotons in there.

I'm a few minutes younger than Geremy and that lets him believe he has the right to make me his slave. Anyways forget him, I also have a younger sister, Julie, she's 11 and she's the favourite one. I see why though, she gets straight A's and is really sporty, but the sportiest one out of us 3 is Geremy, he's a track runner. He also plays basketball, soccer and cricket.\nOnce we finished packing, we gently placed all the suit cases in the boot and Geremy jumped into the car.

It all started in 1867, when a man known as Gregory Holiburton had stolen a prestige battle boat. Gregory and the boat were never found, so as you would expect they were announced dead to sea. But this year, 2016, they have been spotted and everyone is on the search. Many people are looking for Gregory Holiburton and his boat but a young boy,  Lewis Greenly is the youngest but possibly the most determined to figure this out.\nLewis slowly descends deeper and deeper into the light blue sea, bright, shining corals please his eyes and he continues to explore bravely. Lewis gazes around him taking in the beauty of the sea. A small echo of a clatter catches his attention but shaking it off he keeps searching. Since he was a small child Lewis loved jumping into the pool and just feeling the waters cool soothing blanket wrap around him and he is astonished that he enjoys it as much as before.\nSuddenly, a bellowing crack alerts Lewis, quickly reacting, he pulls himself through the water ignoring the aching in his left shoulder. There it is he tries not to get too excited with what he is seeing incase it is a wrong call but this one definetly is not. Covered with a clumps of seaweed and sturdy wood textures, Lewis's eyes nearly burst through his socket. Fingers trembling with excitement, he slides his shaking fingers against the fine, man made material and screams with joy. Making his way inside, Lewis freezes. Burnt black to very last spot, a dreadful, horrific skull stares at Lewis with a sharp stare. Breathing in and out, he prepars himself for what lies ahead. Taking himself closer to a door ahead, Lewis's heart pumps up and down rapidly, his legs shake like loose noodles and his emotions excelerate. Staring into the doors rusty, loose handle he smashes through the door and he now regrets what he had just done.\nSitting right in front of him, legs crossed holding a cold glistening green coloured drink.

{"prompt":"The water of life\nIn a the middle of Zimbabwe lived a tiny town called Binjama with a population of 36 poeple. The weather was always hot and the crops were very hard to grow. The three farmers Hakeem, Abdul and Jaber had the hardest job in town making sure that every crop grew to its maximum size. It was a big struggle but they tried their best to provide for Binjama. The only source of water in Binjama was a pond. Binjama has been living off that pond for decades. Now that pond was shrinking and all the water was expected to run out from two to three weeks. The people were always worried about that but someone by the name of Jimbabwe didn't. After he heard that the water was gone soon he started to make a machine that could potentially give a signal to any country on Earth.\nEven though in Binjama they were short on materials Jimbabwe still mange to make his machine from scrap metal and clay. He had no idea how to send the signal anywhere so he asked his sister, Katrina how to do it. fortunately for Jimbabwe that his sister had read a book about this. As Katrina was looking at the scrap metal and clay that Jimbabwe collected she instantly new what she had to do. During Katrina's construction Jimbabwe was looking at her and had no idea what she was making. Eventually Katrina finished building her mechanism and was ready to put it inside the metal and clay contraption. The device was finally ready but before they could use it someone was calling thier name.\nThey left their room to find out it was thier mum calling them for dinner. They walked to the dinner table ready to eat but realised there wasn't enough food for all three of them. Jimbabwe and Katrina both said to thier mother \" Why isn't there enough food for us?\" Thier mum Replied with \" The farmers aren't able to grow any crops now becuase the water in the pond disappeared.\" They all ate dinner together with a sad face and a worried feeling. Jimbabwe and Katrina know knew that they needed to make the signal device work now. After a few finishing touches Jimbabwe and Katrina now thought to send a signal to somewhere. The both agreed upon sending the signal north-west so The United States could come and save them. They both clicked the button to send the signal and now where waiting for people to save them.\nAfter a day there was no luck, the town were all sitting down in their houses drinking every last drop of water they had. The town was now in a state of depression, they had no more water, no food, were thirsty and starving. But at five o'clock in the morning Jimbabwe heard a wierd sound coming from the sky above. He ran outside and saw three helicopters coming down to save them. As the sound got louder the whole town of Binjama left their houses and were now finally happy that they wouldn't die. When the helicopters parked on the ground the people of Binjama ran to them waiting for the people to come out of the helicopters.  As one of the helicopter doors opened they were all excited to see a man by the name of Mr Apple. He greeted everyone and brought out crates of food and water for the people. The Binjamian People were all jumping up in excitment becuase they were all saved. The food was enough to last the town years. But the town gave all the credit to Jimbabwe and Katrina and gave them the name title of The Saviours.

Then he goes to the kitchen to eat breakfast, toast with vegimite. Once he eats his breakfast Gregory packs his school bag for school. He starts his journey to school. Walking to the bus stop he notices a cat lying on the floor. Gregory starts to tear up and goes to check up on the poor little cat. He poked the cat and the cat jump up all startled and runs off, Gregory gets a sigh of relief that the cat wasn't dead. His journey to the bus stop hasn't ended, so he continues his walk to the bus. On arrival at the bus stop, he is 5 minutes early. He pulls out his phone and headphones and listens to his music until the bus comes. When the bus arrived, Gregory hopped on and waited for his stop. His bus stopped and he got out. He started his walk to school. Once he arrived at school, Gregory walked to his locker and checked what classes he had for the first 3 periods. He pulled out his english and math book and walked to his classroom. Not even 30 minutes into the first period the school alarm goes off. All of his classmates got up and laughed saying \"it's another drill\", but Gregory felt a  sharp pain deep down in his body, thinking something isn't right. The thought of the doorway comes into his mind. Suddenly the teacher shouts out \"every body sit down, let me inquire about the alarm.\". She calls up the head office when the hear a loud bang which sounds like a gun shot. The office answers and the class hear screaming and another loud bang goes off. The lady who picked up the phone shouted into the phone and said \"THERE IS A SHOOTER ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.\". Shots are being fired and Gregory's heart is beating faster and faster by the second. Gregory is trying the think what he can do to save his life and his classes life, when out of the blue he remembers thinking about the doorway. Gregory yells \"the door way.\".\nThe class starts saying back to Gregory \" you know the rumors about the doorway, Dont you? The rumor of the door way is anybody who enters doesn't come back alive. And we are are not going in the doorway.\". Gregory knows that is the only hope of survival because the police wouldn't arrive for another 30 minutes. By the time the police gets here and takes the shooter down, that the shooter would have most likely killed his whole class. Gregory can hear the loud shots and they are not too close to his class or the hallway to the doorway. So he runs down the small hallway and to the doorway. Knowing that there is most likely no hope of survival. Gregory opens the door to the door way and walks inside. Gregory can't see a thing but walks very slowly down the passage from the doorway with his arms out trying to guide himself. He is constintaly bumping into the walls since the passage way is so tight. The room is pitch black and it is silent. He continues walking when all of a sudden its starting to become damp and wet. Gregory is thinking of turning back but there's no point in turning back, he had already walked far enough to give up. Turning around one of the corners he starts seeing faint glimmers of light. He speeds up, the light is getting brighter and brighter. Hearing sirens and screaming he knows the police have arrived. Finally getting to the end Gregory climbs through a small hole, just and the front of the school. He can see the world again and he has made it out alive from the school shootig in one piece. Gregory's mum starts running towards him and hugs him. The paromedics also running to him to give him medical attention. They start checking every where for any wounds or anything that needs medical attention. He gets a deep thought that his friends could be dead right now because they didn't listen to him.

He collected all kinds of things like old watches, lightbulbs and other rubbish that he found off the street.\nThe smell of the wax melting and moth balls grew stronger as he got closer to the counter of the store.

He looked behind him, startled and then quickly ran to the counter. Clink. He placed his box of items on the counter.\n\"Hmm, what do you have for me today?\" Said the man behind the counter in a curious way. He used a purple stick to open the lid of the box and peered inside. \"Let's see, an old cracked watch with crusty old leather that would feel like sand paper scratching on your wrist,\" he looked up at Eddie irrated. \"Pass.\" He threw the watch back into the box. Eddie was worried. Was he going to be able to make any money?\n\"A vintage CD of... what does this even say?\" He opened the case to see if anything on the inside that was valuable. \"What is this!

Scram!\" Rattle! Rattle! Rattle!

Please, just give some of it a try.\"\n\"Don't you see that I have enough in the store. I don't need any of your street rubbish!\" Rattle, rattle, rattle. \"Ugh, I thought I told someone to take care of the rattling! I have a customer!\" He turned around and flicked his green and purple silk robe.\nEddie looked round awkwardly waiting for the man to come back. No matter how many times he came to this pawn shop to sell his belongings, he never gets the amount he deserves. He doesn't even know the owner's name.\n\"Ah! Eyyer! Get off me!\" Exclaimed a faint voice. Eddie was conserned on what was happening. The man was taking a while. Eddie decided to go up to the curtain and take a look. He walked behind the counter trying to avoid the mysterious broken glass. His heart pumping and his nerves creeping slowly inside of him he peeked behind the curtain.\nThere he stood in the middle of a dark room with candles that reminded him of a circus. At the back of this circus room was a big, metal, cage. The cage had a wooden cover at the rop that had white and red stripes, almost like the shape of a circus tent. The door of the cage had been unlocked and broken down. Red splatters covered the walls and ceiling.\nHis breath started to fasten, his legs started to shake and he started to feel the presents of something else in the room watching him.

Getting closer to school, Stacey had started to notice that some of the things Dr. Green had said on the news was coming \ntogether. Like the pieces of the 5000 piece puzzle she had finsihed last night. Maybe that strange man was right, what if something, like that USIST virus is coming to get us.\nStacey had arrived at school, her first class was science. Finally, something good, she thought to herself. She was walking to class but then suddenly the bell went. Had she missed\nclass? It was her second week back at school, she was sure that she was on time. She looked around, everyone was confused too. Stacey was about to ask someone when, 'everybody stay calm.\nThere is a stage four virus called USIST. Please evacuate the building you are in immediately.' Stacey was right. Just like her 5000 piece puzzle, it had taken her maybe years to finish it,\ncollecting all the pieces, and when she was done, she saw a clear image of what the puzzle was of, it was a sign saying 'Stay calm and be happy!' Stacey had gotton all the clues from the news\nlike how New York is dirty and disguting, the man coughing on the street, and now the school talking about this same virus that was on the news. She knew it. The scientists must have\nlet it out somehow. And now it's spreading and probably catching people slowly and slowly, untill everyone will get it. What on Earth are they supposed to do now? New York is doomed.\nStacey's mom is a highly trained surgeon and has surgical masks and home. Stacey ran home an fast as possible, trying not to breath in peoples air or trip on any pollution. She knows that there are \nsome blue ones, in the right draw under the kitchen sink. She stuggeled to unlock the door with her sweaty finger tips, but she did it. She grabbed one and turned around and saw her mother rocking back\nand forth on the couch. She looked like she was reassuring herself. Stacey, sadly, did not have time for her. Ages ago she thourgherly planned a plan if something like this happened. That's was all\nshe was capable of in maths anyways. She ran back out the door, hopefully her mother didn't worry too much about her. Stacey had studied hard in science, espescially in viruses and disease. \nAll she had to do was run all the way around New York, tell every person about this and what's going to happen. And supply them with a surgical mask, easy peasy.She didn't want to waste\nany more time. After all, that's the least she can do to try and help.\nSlowly but surely, Stacey noticed how quickly this is spreading. She had read about science exeriments and how this could actually happen. Well surprise, surprise, it did. This is dangerous running around like\nthis. The world sinking into the giant deep, dark, scary hole of USIST. Everyone's muscles getting weaker and slowly trapping there body in and endless cycle that will never, ever end. Leaving them in pain and suffering.\nShe handed out things as quick as possible, trying to keep up with the madness. She ran past soemone, quite old and wrinkely, coughing madly, she felt a drop of saliva topple onto her skin. Hopefully it dosen't do much.\nStacey just kept running and running, she had all this energy that was meant to be used to school. Oh well, it's at better use right now. She had been running for almost 5 minutes at full speed, and she wasn't tired. She never \nwas. Her Mom used to call her an Olympian. But all of sudden, the world fickered to a dark, grey and dull work. She was blinking to try and get it away, but it didn't go away. Her mouth was dry, and she felt light headed.\nMaybe she just needed a break. She stopped to let her feet rest. But instead she started coughing. She didn't think much of it first. She physically could not. Her mouth was dry. Stacey thinks it caught her. 'Oh well, at least I tried.' \nAnd she collapsed onto the floor. The world spinning in it's dark grey colour. 'Maybe...someone will save me..' Her eyes shut closed, permanently.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 2 2 3 1 2\n"}
{"prompt":"The water of life\n\"CRASH!\" the wave crashed ontop of Jono and Christian. Every day, they both went out surfing at their local beach. Over time, they had both become spectacular on a surfboard and even better swimmers. Although, this day was different as behind them, secretly following them, was a hungry shark with gold and ivory skin. It wasn't until\nlater that day they realised who it really was.\n\"Lets go deeper!\" suggested Christian, who was the better surfer. Jono didn't agree it would be safe but eventually agreeded with his best friend. They got pulled by a rip out father and farther until neither of them could see the shore. Scared, Jono decided he would go back to shore. That was a bad idea because as soon as he got out of the rip, he noticed a shark looming up behind them, gradually getting closer and closer to them. The two boys struggled and struggled but knew that the shark would eventually get to them and when it did, surprisingly it didn't attack them but instead talked to them. \"Come to my palace, 20 nautical miles east, and you will find me waiting there, ready for your quest.\" Reluctantly, the duo decided to go there but knew that when they got there, it would not be an easy task they needed to complete.\nWhen they got to their destination, they didnt find anything there but ocean. Confused, Jono decided to look around their surroundings. There was nothing but ocean but then, he noticed a shipwreck. He drifted toward it and when he was above it, swum down to explore. He noticed that strangely, all the fish were gone and all that remained was the coral and de-formed peices of wood. Then, he saw a flash of gold appear behind him and turned towards it. He was amazed by what he saw. It was a man with full gold armour, spotted with aged seagrass. At first, he didn't know who it was but then noticed the massive gold trident in the Sea God's muscular arm. It was Poseidon.\nJaw-dropped, Jono asked him why he was here \"Why did you invite me here?\" he asked with general questioning, but the Sea God thought it was a joke and laughed so loud, he must've caused an underwater earthquake.\n\"Oh you know Smith, you know.\" he boomed.\n\"How do you know my last name?\" Jono asked, not really wanting to know the answer. He was tempted to leave but would he want to anger the god of the sea? He didn't really care, so he went back into the water and swum up to meet his best friend. But as soon as he left, the muscules in his body stopped working and he floated back down to the god.\n\"'Sup\" he said desperately, when he was on the ground. \"Just checking the water temperature.\"\n\"You disrespect me boy.\" Poseidon snarled, thrusting the blades of his trident towards him, striking him down in an instant.\nUnexpectedly, as soon as the blades struck Jono down, he came back to life, this time, a glowing persona. He was now as divine as any god, thanks to the Water of Life, kept in Poseidons own garden.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 2 2 1 2 2\n"}
{"prompt":"The doorway\nWhile I was walking aroung the streets of Rome,Ilatym I saw a little boy run through a door way and then just vanish into thin air. Thousods of dollars in hand he seemed to just apear like he vanished, I walked over to get  better look and asked the boy where he got all the money from. I did not have amazing Ilatian so I could just make out that 'doorway give imagine.' so I walked in thinking of money just like the little boy did and as I walked through it was like a curtain got pulled away and showed the real room filled with money piled from the ground to the celling all what looks to be real money. being human I grabbed as much as posible and stuffed it in the back pack I carry ever where. This was unreal. all of the money I had worked hard for in my thirty years of working as a lawyer would not even be a tenth of the money before me. I called ever single person I knew to tell them about it but then I realsied I had made a mistake and that i should not have told the people I told and so i recalled all of them to say it was a joke. Every picked up exept for one of my best friens who I know takes everything serously and when I called he said he will spread the word aroud which was fine before but now is not good. I had already told him where I was staying and where the doorway is so all I could do is wait for him to turn up and try to convince him that it was just a dream or something. When he turned up I knew it was to late to make up something. Trying to stop him was my only chance other wise who knows what other people will do with it and I thought I convinced him to not go but when he rang the door bell with thousonds of dollars in his hands I knew that I stuffed up. Standing near the door way seeing a constant flow of people going in with duffel bags and coming out with more money than some of the welthest people alivez, it was like seeing the down fall of the earth. Wehen it hit the news that was when people started to realise that this door was not a gift but more like a curse, but it was to late the dollar already droped, you could not even buy a loaf of bread for under one hundred dollars. people could not afford rent anymore nor could they afford to pay their bills leaving many people with our running water, electricity, gas for cooking so many people where forced to sell their house. Flights to anywhere around Italy where over one million each way for those who did not get a couple million from the door would not be able to live like the people who did. The amount of seperation from the poor to the rich was extreme in every contry. Someone had to do something and being the one who leaked it I had to fix the problems. I came up with an idea if you cant get through to door you cant get the goods so if i destroy the building then the door will hope fully get destoryed as well. So one night when the line was not very big I started the day before I hired a big crane as fast as I could I linked it up to a wrecking ball and started smashing as soon as someone came out people moved away from the building some of them ran for my crane but they didnt do much they just punched on the glass. Just as I planed the doorway came down like any other would and the room was gone, flatend to the ground. unexpectedly but fourtunatly all the money and other things made by the door vanished. I supose things when't back to normal. people did not forget though it was all the rage of the news and everyone wanted to get there money back. But  it was better for the world to have it how it was.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 0 1 1 1 1\n"}

{"prompt":"The Water of Life\nI am far from the first to write a story of this powerful essence, and I will be far from the last. The Water of life was a true wonder of mankind. No one understood the healing properties it posessed, nor the beasts it had brought into the world. And there was nought we could do but wonder. It was told to cure the most vile and formiddable diseases, heal scars of a lifetime of war. Resting in the peak of Mt. Fury, the magical elixer was surrounded by powerful creatures and guardians of stone, conjured to End the life of any who dared to drink from the great fountain. And still, knowing all these dangers, I embarked on this journey.\nI had arrived at my home from my apprenticeship at the blacksmiths, when I found what events had taken place. Our walls were smeared with blood, my mother and father missing. A hacking cough rang out through the shack, snatching away my attention. Horus. I sprinted into my brothers room, where I found him, lying on the floor, close to coughing up his own lungs. A small pool of blood was forming near his mouth. It was the ancient plague.\n\"Horus!\" I screamed, running to is writhing figure.\n\"Help me, Selethen!\" He cried out, before withdrawing back into a fit of coughs. i pick up my brother, running to the old doctor.\n\"Help!\" I said, banging on the door. I slammed my fist against the wood, hoping beyond hell to be heard. The door swung open, and the doctors face met mine.\n\"Selethen. What is the problem?\" He asked, as a grave look took hold of his features.\n\"He's coughing up blood. I think it's the ancient plague!\" I cried out in dismay. \"Can you help us?\"\n\"Get him inside and lie him on the table.\" The doctor instructed, running back through the doorway. I followed after him, and set my younger brother down on the bed. The doctor grabbed small powders and mushrooms, crushing them and putting them in water. He sat my brother up.\n\"Try and hold your cough boy.\" He said, pouring them down his throat. But my brother simply coughed them back up. \"It's no good.\" The doctor explained as I clutched my brother. \"Only the water of life can save him.\"\n\"Then I'll get it!\" I exclaimed. \"I'll do anything to save him.\"\n\"Selethen, that's prepostouros.\" The doctor scolded me. \"You could die.\"\n\"I don't care!\" I screamed. \"I'll do it no matter what.\" I ran out of the doctors office, sprinting to mr Wulf's house. He saw me coming.\n\"Selethen? Why are you here?\" He asked, shining a lantern towards me.\n\"Horus is sick!\" I called out, sprinting on. \"He needs the water of life!\"\n\"The water of life?\" He started to look puzzled. \"How in the hells do you think you'll be getting that?\" I stopped, panting. I pointed to the small shed behind his workshop, where he keeps weapons.\n\"Could I take a weapon? I'll take one that I made, one that isn't high quality and doesn't have any orders.\" I pleaded. He looked down at me, and I thought he would refuse me.\n\"Take a shield too.\" He instructs. I breathed a sigh of relief.\n\"Thank you.\" I speak, relieved beyond all measure. \"Thank you so much!\"\n\"Just try to get everything back in one piece. That includes yourself.\" He joked.\n\"I'll try!\" I called back. I went to the shed, and wrenched open the door. I saw a wide array of weapons, but my eyes set on a longsword and a nice, rounded shield. I snatched up the scabbard, and attached it to my belt, before slinging the shield over by back. Finally, I ran to the house of my great friend, Duran. \"Duran!\" I yelled out, hoping he'd answer me. I watchedthe high window leading into his quaters. A head popped out.\n\"What?\" He asks. He smiled broadly.\n\"Horus got the ancient plague!\" I yelled up to him, watching his smile turn to a frown. \"He needs the water of life. Want to go on a quest?\" I asked.\n\"Eh, why not.\" He said, grinning again. He pulled his head back into his room, and I heard clanging. Eventually, His door swung open, revealing him in his nightware, baring a sword and dagger. \"Let's go!\" He said. We walk back to the doctors house. I pushed open the door, and see the doctor attempting to adminester more treatment to Horus. He turned to me.\n\"Are you seriously going to do this?\" He asked, features contorted into a concerned look. I nodded conformation. \"Very well.\" He sighed. \"No stopping you now.\"\n\"Keep Horus safe for me.\" I said, before turning and leaving. We walked onwards, towards the path to Mt. Fury. Arriving at the path, Duran turned towards me, a serious look apon his face.\n\"Are you ready?\" He asked.\n\"As I'll ever be.\" I replied. And with that, we stole off into the night, prepared for any beast in our path.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 3 3 3\n"}

A few miles east from were the young man who lived with his dog who was a golden retriever named ruby, was a massive gloomy theme park that never got any attention.\nRuby was a great dog although she may have turned more brown than here original gold colour. Town was always gloomy and not very inviting but today the sun was shining and the town was full of energy.\nJamie headed towards his front door some paint peeling of it with Ruby's leash in his hands, whenever ruby wanted to go for a walk she would sit at the front door and wait till the door opened. Ruby jumped up when she Jamie with the leash in his hand. As Jamie clipped on the leash to her collar she started spinning around in circles. when he opened the door she ran out and pulled Jamie across the front yard.\nAs we walked down the street a bird landed on the ground a couple of meters away, then suddenly something snapped and Ruby was sprinting towards the bird. The bird seemed to be heading towards the theme park at the the end of the street. Ruby chased the bird starring at it like it was a flying steak. the bird flew right over the theme park walls, surely Ruby couldn't get in but he thought wrong and she crawled right under the entry bars which where about as high as a carten of milk and went up about a meter high. As Jamie chased after Ruby he realised that as soon as he passed through the gates of the theme park everything got dark and gloomy and the walls seemed almost blood stained. Ruby was running towards a tall building inside the theme park he sprinted towars Ruby shouting her name over and over, but she wouldn't listen Jamies head pounded and his heart ached as he chased after Ruby. The building that Ruby had entered wasnt just any building it was the haunted house, as Jamie entered a small roller coaster rattled towards him, as it got closer a dark figure poked it's head out of the roller coaster a pair of yellow eyes rose from the carrage and then a bark came from inside the carrage and the figure dropped down so he ran up towards it thinking it was Ruby but then she ran towards him from where the carrage had come from, whimpering and as the carrage went past Jamie lifted Ruby up she was only a puppy so she's decently light, and then the figure lifted itself up again and stepped out of the carrage its steps where heavy like it was made out of pure metal. It started to pick its pace, so Jamie swiftly turned around looking straight at the exit and ran as fast as he could carrying Ruby in his arms the figure behind him becam taller and faster and soon was right behind him as he reached the exit he saw through the exit that the town was destroyed and black smock clouds were everywhere but he quickly realised out there was better than in here and pushed on the gate but it just rattled he quickly spun and saw the figure closing in on him, it was walking again now which gave Jamie enough time to find something to defende himself he ran into the office and on the office chair lay a sledgehammer a bottle of wine which looked much out of date, a cloth and a box of matches. He ran to the office door he came in through and closed and locked it, he quickly took of the cap off the wine bottle put the cloth in it and got out a match. The door bashed down on the ground and the figure came through he lighted the match and lit the match and set the cloth on fire Jamie threw the bottle at the figure and it set alight Ruby barked and barked until the figure was a burnt hunk of metal on the ground.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 2 1 1 1 0\n"}

Jerry had no idea where he was so he just walked, in hope he would find something like an exit. A left turn, a right, right at the fork and left again. He walked for a few minutes until he spotted something. On the floor lay a map. A paper map like the one you would find at a theme park. It was a theme park like he thought. Deep in Jerry's brain, a memory was retrieved. He was at the theme park, he went to the maze and how he got in was completly unknown. Nothing else.\nHe reached down and snatched the map up. It had a few words faintly scribbled on it. \"Behind you,\" Jerry read, filling with fear. He had seen a few horror movies. Jerry didn't look back. He ran, somehow dodging all dead ends. His heart beat faster than a proffesional drummer. A leafy wall stood in front of him. Dead end. He looked around. He expected some sort of creature to turn around the corner. Nothing.\nJerry walked back tracing his steps. What did it mean by behind you? The map appeared in view again. Jerry picked it back up. There were some small words he didn't notice before. This always had to happen to him. \"You want to know were the exit is? Behind you,\" Jerry read again. He turned and nothing was there. The sun was getting low. How long had he been in here? He had no food, no water and a liar map.  Jerry looked at the map for a way out. The maze was scribbled out. Jerry climbed up the hedge to try get out again. Hedges as far as the eye can see. The maze looked infinite. But the maze looked like a circle and circle mazes have something in the middle. It was worth a shot. He climbed back down and began wandering inwards. He walked for a long time. When Jerry was almost tired out, the centre of the maze appeared. It was a garden, with a rainbow of flowers. Water features decorated the garden and in the middle of it all a door. He walked to the door, ignoring the rest of the garden. The door was light brown, with a golden knob. Jerry grabbed the knob, twisted and pushed.\nHe was blinded for a few seconds but when he opened his eyes he was back in the middle of the theme park. People chatting, rides blaring their music and the midday sun throwing light over everything. \"That was weird, it was the afternoon when I escaped but now it's midday,\" Jerry said aloud.

She was then later thrown in front of a tall gate with the words, BACKROOMS, imprinted in them. Maria spun around ever so quickly to try run back to reality, after minutes of trying to turn back a bright neon green light appeared to her left. EXIT THIS WAY, EXIT THIS WAY, EXIT THIS WAY, the sign flashed with an arrow pointing in the direction of the building, it was a tall slim pointy edged building with only one window at the far top. Maria glanced up at the top of biulding towards the window and she saw a dark shadow quickly dash away from the circular window. Marias heart pounded against her chest her hands trembled her knees were weak and her palms were sweaty. sweat beaded down her forhead. There were tombstones all over the yellow dry grass. Mria read IN LOVING MEMORY OF RALPH DELPHONSO (TIME 3:34). Maria instantly fell to the ground and sobbed. Her fathers life was taken the same way hers will be.\nMaria walked through the door to the building and ran foor the exit down the slim hall, lights flashed and doors creaks, the exit stood proud and green. Maria pushed open the door but in turned to dust as she made contact and she fell on her back in the same slim hall. She heard footsteps behind her and quickly checked over her shoulder but no one was to be seen. Maria ran to the nearest door and ran through only to find a skeleton smiling at her. STAY CALM DEAR IT FEEDS ON YOUR STRESS AND PANIC. Maria heard a soothing voice comfort her a little, Maria beleived it was her father. She calmly paced towards the second door only do for a classroom of shriveled up mummies to turn each head at her, she felt each pair of eyes on her. The class then disintegrated and Maria was met with a uneven set of stairs each stair had an obstacle built into it. Maria fist hopped over a burning stair and onto a stair of water. She fell through  the water unable to breath.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 2 2 2 2 1\n"}
{"prompt":"The boy falls. His eyes opening. He manages to look around him. A deep black void surrounds him as his anxiety rises. \"No.. No...NO!\" he yells. He turns around to see below him. A fiery pit with silver, sharp spikes, adding to the anxiety. He closes his eyes.\nAnd he jumps up off his bed. \"Wait... what?\" He exclaimed.\n\"Pete, shut up can you?\" someone yells arcoss the house.\n\"Oh,\" he sighed, \"just a dream.\" His sister, Sarah,  barges into the room, her face became pale red.\n\"I said be quiet!\" She shouted. \"I'm doing very important business right now.\" she said as she lowered her voice. Pete got back onto his bed, with a smug face.\n\"Like what? Texting with your facebook friends?\" He questioned sarcastically. She frowned, fists clenched together, phone in one hand. Pete looked to the side of her, and tried to see what she was doing on her small phone. He had guessed right. She turned off her phone as soon as she noticed, now her face was as red as a tomato. She grunted and trudged out of the room, slamming the door so hard that is felt like an earthquake.\nPete looked at the time, his digital clock blared '11.00' . His eyes widened. He swiftly got out of his bed and got prepared to go outside.\nHe got out of his room, wearing a bland, white hoodie and jeans, to complement his hoodie. He ran out the door, \"See ya sis!\" he exclaimed.\n\"I'm doing very important business Pete!\" she shouted, again. His father was mowing the garden, wearing a cowboy-like hat and sweating  a bit too much. He noticed Pete going out of the maroon, front door and down the brick steps.\n\"Hiya son! Watcha doin'?\" He asked, turing around to see him. \"Looking so fancy eh?\"\nPete stopped at the front gate, also turning around to see his dad.\"Dad, it's the US. There are millions of people here without an Australian accent.\" he sighed. Without hesitation, Pete took off running through the dilapidated gate and out onto the sidewalk.\nPete took off, through a bustling city filled with towering buildings and hundreds of people in front of him.  Noise filled the air as the only thing he could hear were people talking and he couldn't even think properly.He ran on the cobbled sidewalk, and managed to trip over a stone that laid in front of him. \"Omph!' he said. Face flat on the floor.\nHe got up, dusting his knees. But... as he looked up, something didn't seem right. Everyone was gone. The building that almost blocked the sky became missing. He looked back down on the sidewalk he was on but it had vansihed. Leaving a patch of grass that he stood on. He looked up again, now that desolate land turned into a lush forrest, filled with bright green trees and tall plant. But then again, there wasn't any form of life other than that. \"Another dream huh? No one can fool me!\" He slapped himself in the face trying to force himself to wake up.  But it...didn't... work.\nHe was startled. He looked around for something to wake himself up with,  but he saw something  else peculiar.\nA path.\nHe paced forward, hoping to find a way out of his place. He followed the path,  it went straight, so he did, it kept going straight, so he did too. Until he noticed that there was a split path. A sign had said, 'choose the right one and you would be free. But choose the worng one, and you would be stuck in a loop.'\n\"Darn, missed an opportunity to rhyme it there.\" he chuckled. But that didn't help with his situation. He had to pick a path. Which would be choose? Would it be the path leading to the left or the path leading to the right? How could I choose? 'Eenie meenie miney mo.. the one on the left I guess?' he thought.\nHe paced onward to the left path. His anxiety started to grow. Did He choose the right one? Did he choose the worng one? Why did he choose it in a sloppy way? Or was it in a good way?\nPete couldn't think. His hands trembled, his eyes were watering but he didn't know why. He only just felt nervous, not sad. The path lead to a wide hole. He turned around, a wall blocked the path. So he jumped into the hole and closes his eyes.\nThe boy falls. His eyes opening.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 3 3 2\n"}

Oh well, I thought bitterly, at least it wasn't an actual danger. Now that I was awake I knew there was no point in me going back to sleep so I decided to gaze at the beautiful scenery down below.\nThen I heard the sound again but this time it wasn't my noisy neighbour, but an actual explosion.

I rolled my eyes, dying in a plane crash is sooo cliche.

They were all dirty and smelly and just wanted to go home and have a shower but half way from the house someone stopped them. He was old and looked horrified. He yelled \"you have to help me!\"\nHe explained that \"my house is doing some weird things and I need your help trying to figure it out!\"\nSo we went to his house. When we got there nothing looked weird, we asked him what's weird about this house but when we turned around he had gone. The only thing left was the keys on the floor. Suddenly a big gust of wind wept past us but we were already there so we got the keys and went inside.\nWe unlocked the door and we both stepped inside and all of a sudden a bright light flashed before our eyes only to realise we were somewhere completely different. Jordan started yelling and was scared out of his mind but Ayden was so calm for some reason, it was almost as if he had done this before. After ten minutes of trying to calm Jordan down Ayden finally managed to calm him down. \"Now I have read a story on this and I think I know how to get out of it but you have to listen to me ok?\" asked Ayden.\nSo Jordan decided to listen only because he wanted to leave this place. 15 minutes had passed and Jordan is starting to loose hope but Ayden is still trying really hard. It was like 9:30pm and no sign of them leaving anytime soon. Ayden was trying to figure out which direction to go in and Jordan was trying to figure out where they were in the world.\nAfter Jordan had realised where they were (which was Africa) Ayden knew exactily where to go.

As they stepped through the door they were back at home but at a different house this time and they had no idea where there house was.\nIt was very late I think it was around midnight and Jordan felt like passing out but Ayden was very persistent and didn't want to rest until he got home. So Ayden and Jordan started to walk in a random direction. After like half an hour they saw something very familiar but they had to get closer to tell. As they got closer they realise it was what they thought it was. It was the man that sent them to Africa. They stormed up to him and asked him what was going on.\nThe man explained that \"It was a test to firstly see if you too could work together and secondly help out an old man if needed and you passed.\" We were shocked.

Catching ants, to worms and even stray cats and shoving them in rusty old cages to take high up into the large building in the moutains. It was 3059 and it was thought humans were the beyond superior species and all other animals should be tortured. But there was one man who thought different from the rest his name was Jose and in his breif case he carried to work each day he kept a little yellow canerie in a nicely polished cage knowing what would happen if he let it go, he had to keep it. He had seen what they do to the animals firsthand since he used to work as one of them, but after the unimaginable happened, he knew what was happening was wrong.\nToday was a Friday which ment it was Jose's day off.

{"prompt":"The Maze\nThe damp air filled my lungs as I jolted myself awake. Everything was dark and I didn't recognise were I was. Though after sitting up, I notoiced that I was in a dingy hallway. Both ends of this hallway faded into inky darkness, and the walls looked like a Greek marble. The floor was just dirt, but it was firm, likely from being walked all over for a very, very long time.\nMy head felt like it would pop off, and float to the ceiling as the blood rushed to my brain. The pins-and-neadles in my legs, felt like fire ants were biting and crawling under my skin. As I brought up the courage to venture into the darkness, hand on my bronze dagger's sheath, my ears picked up on an ungodly, bellowing roar coming from somewhere close in the labourynth. I picked up the pace, knowing that I would much rather me find it, than it find me.\nAfter sprinting, crawling and stumbling down hallways, around scary traps and pools of scalding hot lava, I felt that my energy had depleted completely and I fell to the ground on my hands and knees. The third, throaty roar sounded closer than usual, as if the thing knew I was here, that or it was just expecting it's dinner from King Minor. Either way, I had to find a way out of here, if one existed. King Minor had this maze built for his own, pure entertainmen. 20 other young men and women were stuck down here with me, just waiting in horror as we were stalked by the fabled Minotor.\nSuddenly, like a bolder smacking me in the head, I realised something. I was lost. King Minor had made the greatest Greek inventor of all time create this shifting maze, and I was going to die down here.\nBut... not if I could find Adrianet's string. My friend knew her before King Minor threw him in here with the others.\nMy pace quickened and the shifting maze's walls rushed past me, shifting from marble, to wood, and the occasional, long dead skeleton wizzed past too. Find the string. Find the string. The thought echoed in my head like a voice in an empty cavern.\nThe fourth throaty roar sounded, but this time was different. Dust and dirt rained from the ceiling as I felt the ground beneath me shake. The narrow hallway I was in opened into a huge, circle, marble room.\nThe fact that the room was circular, and had marble walls was the least of my problems. Towering tall and mighty, stood the Minotor. Fear snatched me up into a choke-hold. The marble walls closed in. Don't panic, if you panic you are an easy target.\nFor those who dont know, the Minotor is an Anchient Greek monster, with the body of an enourmous man, and the head of a bull. The Minotor has a all the sences of a bull, but they are all razor sharp. It was thrown into the Labourynth to kill all the prisoners that King Minor threw in here with it, but sometimes The King just threw random people in here for his own amusment.\nI sliped my dagger out of the shieth even though I knew that if it came to close combat, I would almost certanly be doomed.\n\"Come at me.\"\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 3 3 3 3 3\n"}

{"prompt":"Chatter and laughter danced through the bright woods on this Monday morning. The sun shone on glistening leaves, dark trunks and all kinds of wildlife skittering through the dense undergrowth. Sensing the humans, the mice turned and ran as Eliabeth raced past, Rose, Alex and Eugene not far behind. \"We have to make it back or breakfast will be cold!\" Elizabeth panted, slowing down. \"But I'm so tired!\" Alex, her friend complained.                                        \"Oh fine. Let's rest.\" The group sat on a log, slightly damp with morning dew, and admired their surrounds. Small mammals peeked out of holes and birds twittered, gliding on carefree wings. The earthy scent of the bush mingled with that of fragrant petals, taken from rambling bushes. Eugene stood, and proclaimed that it was time to go. He looked around for the path, but it wasn't there anymore.\nAfter 10 minutes of panicked searching, Alex realised that they were getting nowhere. \"We know the path was there, but not anymore. Let's just keep going the way we were. Then we can make it back it back to camp and figure out what happened.\" The others all agreed, so the left the log and strode onwards. After walking for nearly 350 metres, they all realised that not one of them recognised their surroundings. Gone were the bright evergreen trees, and the cheeky mice. All that was there, ahead and behind them was barren, desolate trees, all leaves long reduced to soil, and all animals under it. Ruby, who was afraid, whimpered shakily \"Guys? What are we going to do now?\" No one knew. Everyone wanted to.\nStuck in the other forest for hours, they started to hallucinate. At least, they hoped they were hallucinating. They saw flames appear in the distance, only to vanish in seconds, long fingered creatures in rags, hungry eyes black and empty dash around trees, and most scarily, someone else, following them on the horizon. Slowly creeping up on them. Stealthily. As if they thought they hadn't been seen.\nDesperate to escape, the children reasone that they might get help from the mystery person, and could probably knock them out if they had to. So, with this in mind, they made their first good decision. Upon meeting them, they learned the man was called David, and he had been stuck here for several years. He took them to his shelter, and that was where he revealed who he really was.\n\"I am not David, nor am I your ally. I am certainly not your friend, but I will give you a chance to escape my creation. Yes, this enchanted forest is mine, and yes, I could kill you in less than a second. But kindly ignore that, as if you become scared I will not give you your chance to escape.\"\nHe disappeared on the spot, leaving only an egg, a massive, speckled red egg. It was as tall as Eugene, who was 14. Suddenly heat swarmed out of the egg and through the cave they were in. It rocked and cracked, and a baby dragon tumbled out. The kids cowered against the wall, terrified of the baby behemoth in front of them, capable of reducing them to cinders. However, the 'baby behemoth' thought they were it's siblings, so did not eat them on the spot. They realised that this dragon must be their chance, so accepted it and called it Fin.\nAfter leaving they cave, Fin in tow, the kids realised that even with a dragon, they still didn't know how to escape, as Fin wasn't strong enough to carry them in the air. They did know they were thirsty though. They found a spring, and upon drinking it gained strength several times their usual levels. While uprooting a tree, in her anger at being here alone and without help or escape, Ruby had a stroke of inspiration. She ran to her friends, the first smile since they got here on her face. \"If we give Fin (Here Fin stood up with a curious snarf sound) some strength water, maybe he could fly us out of here!\" Excited, they gave Fin strength water and piled on his back. Then they took off.\nWind whistled past their ears, cold air biting through their summer clothes. The groud spread out like a map under them, allowing them to see every minute detail, including the path. The path! Their exit! The told Fin to go down and-\nThe were stopped. By another dragon. This one at least five times Fin's size and angry. Very angry. Fin ducked, weaved. Breathed flame. The kids hang on for dear life, fire and wind playing havoc with their senses. Flame blinded them, burnt them. Wind threatened to toss them off Finn, down on to the harsh ground, where they would never get up. They knew there was one way out.\nFin dove down past the talons of the other dragon, the sharp limestone green scales, nearly at the path. Closer, closer, closer. At the last second he leveled with the ground, barrelling through the portal from this world, back the children's. They would have a lot of explaining to do back at camp.\nThey flew into camp on Fin's back, the strength water just wearing off. All the adults said they would need some coffee for this explanation, so once they had their coffee, the kids told their story, the story you just read. Fin went on to become massive, and live on an island in the bermuda triangle, though he occasionally went back for visits to his siblings. They all lived, maybe not happily, but with an excellent story and even more excellent friends.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 3 3 3 3 3\n"}

It was known to have a leader one that was very selfish and ungrateful who wanted the kingdom all to himeself. It was the worlds mission to discover this mysterious kingdom and teach the leader a very valuable lesson.\nPeople all over the world knew about this kingdom but no one was ever brave enough to dare to explore it although that was soon to change.\nOne day there was a ship taking tourists from Greece to the UK  and on there journey their ship got caught on something mysterious and unknown under the water. \"We have got cought on something unexpected and it looks like we might have to call another ship to continue your journey\", announced the dissapointed ship driver.

He then dived into the cold, dirty water and swam straight to the botom where he saw something that looked like an entrance. He swam straight through but was unwantingly greated by the leader. \"What do you think you are doing here Mr. You are not worthy enough to enter my magnificent kinngdom\", shouted the unworthy leader.

{"prompt":"The Maze\ni was walking up the steep, misty hill, as i looked up at the stary night sky, i spotted a mysterious, pitch black van aproaching me, my palms started sweating as it got closer and closer, i had a gut feeling that they weren't here for a good reason. As soon as saw the veichle park next to me, i sprinted, faster and faster, until my vision was a blur, i had lost them. I was originally going to wait for my limusine to pick me up, but fate had another plan.\nI walked through the towering, glass doors or my mansion, i felt a breeze of floral mists, ah yes, lucy, my maid was cleaning the house. \"Hello Sir!\" she shouted franticly, dropping the detergant that has slipped out of her frail hand, \"so sorry sir, i am terribley clumsy\" She put on a concerned smile and got back to house work. I sighed and walked up the glistening, marble staircase, lucy had perviously cleaned, and into my office, i peered at myself through the mirror facing the balcony, my gucci suit that i had bought just yesterday was smudged with wine! \"ARGH\" i groaned and changed into my silk pyjays.\nThe Next morning, i woke up to chattering outside, the house, i peered out the balcony and saw, in the distance, the same black van, My heart stopped as my breath caught in my throught, a figure pointed to me, and they drove of in an instant, i was suprised lucy didn't wake me up, i looked down at my rolex watch, it was 9:00am! i was meant to be in my suit and off to work by 8:30am \"DARN IT LUCY\" i shouted and rushed down the spiriling marble staircase, \"lucy?\"\n\"Maybe shes gardening\" i thought to myself. I rushed through the front door, no sign of lucy anyways, i peered down and saw a letter.\n\"we have taken you're beloved maid, come to the adress 1876 Smiths street, you'll find her there, we have got a challenge awaiting you\"\n\"WHATTTT\" i roared as i rushed to my glimering, red porshe, as the engine groaned, they had popped my tires, \"maybe the buggati?\" i thoguth to myself. I had hid the buggati in the undeground garage, it has face ID so it was phisically impossible for anyone to get it, i grabbed the keys and opened the garage, there it was, my black buggati. \"My precious, your papas back!\" i grabbed the keys and the engine roared. \"IM GOING TO FIND YOU LUCY!\"\nI arrived at the adress 3 hours later, \"how far is this darn place\" i thought to myslef. It was, A MAZE? No? A LABARINTH? Whatever it was it sure looked puzzling, old beige bricks, hedges surrounding it, i looked to my left and saw a figure rushing out of that darn pith black van, \"HEY, FREEZE\" i screamed, but the shadowy figure was already gone, i tip toed into the maze caucsisly. \"LUCY? ITS ME, CHAD\"\n\"CHAD!\" she shouted back, her voice was shakey and unsure. I rushed into the maze without hesitation and lucy screamed\n\"BE CAREFUL IN THERE, THERES TRAPS AND BEARS AND SNAKES AND-\" all or a sudden her voice stopped, \"lucy? LUCY?\" i screamed back i give up i ran further and further, deeper and deeper into the maze, i jumped over snakes, hid frome bears, tracked me steps, until i came across a man, weaping on the floor.\n\"Help me, and ill set you free\" i wasnt falling for it, in those old comics i used to read, these type of traps always were and obstical, and never failed to trick me while reading the story, \"give it up old man, you cant trick me!\" i exclaimed and voyaged further into the maze.\nThere! i saw lucy, standing right infront of me \"LUCY!\" I cried out and went in for a hug, but as i wiped the tears away, i realised it was an ilusion.\n\"LUCY? BAHAHAHAHA!\" A deep voice shouted \"im no lucy\" the man smiled suspiciously, and bang, i was out like a light, he had wacked me on the head with a wooden bat!\ni woke up in a dark room, tied up on a wooden rocking chair. \"WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!\" i shouted, tears streaming down my eyes, my fists cleanchingas a vein popped in my neck.\n\"You're money big guy.\" The man smirked \"Hand you're card over, and well set you free\"\n\"WHAT ABOUT LUCY!\" i roared, staring them dead in the eye.\n\"Lucy went shopping in the morning, and forgot to wake you up, you fell for our trap, now all we need is your money\" i started down at the concrete floor and just as i was about to give up, the FBI busted open the door \"FREEZE, BUT YOUR HANDS UP AND DROP THE WEAPON!\" i jolted my head up to see lucy standing behind them.\nAfter the criminals where sent away to prison, lucy explained to me, the criminals had left there phone in the house, which was tracking my location, thats how she was able to find me and call the police, and also explained how they where able to find me all the time.\nI started tearing up and hugged lucy as tight as i possibley could, the FBI escorted me home, and the criminals where sentenced 37 years in prison, luckily i had lucy.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 3 2 2 2 2 1\n"}
{"prompt":"The doorway\nTravelling in a car isn't fun. Definitely for hours on end. 4 hours and 21 minutes to be exact. Lying down in the backseat, my head dizzy and throat carring vomit. The vomit may be from the bumby gravel and sharp turns, but maybe also from the cockroach infestation in our house. Those beasts posioning our food with ease, even picturing those rodents send another lump down my throat. Either way, the pest controller were sure to 'take care' of it, but in my opinon, the cockroachs should not be 'taken care of', that would a polite gesture after they did their filthy act. My parents are part of the procedure to take care of them, normally my lively and respectable mum would be leading the way to grandmas, making less sharp turns. But, my grandma, also lively and respectable, was driving. Dreaming of cockroaches and posioned rice, I begin to dose off.\nLooming over, the dark brick castle was ready to bite. The temperature dropped as I left my comfortable huddling postion. Wind prickled at my skin, sweeping my brown hair, aggressively pulling it. Great vines seemed to have grown mischieviously between the large, black gate, so much it couldn't be open by the mechanical pulley sytem, they installed only so long ago. \"Sorry dear to wake you,\" My grandma apologised, sweeping her grey locks of hair behind her ear, \"not the best weather today, but I'm sure your stay will be enjoyable.\"\nLifting suitcase, after suitcase, to reality kicked in. This would be my house for the next three weeks. At the most. At least, that's what mum said to comfort me. The suitcases we carried were dropped off in my new room. I've never even moved house before, calling another room 'mine' feels.. off. Cream walls, with a king sized bed, with pillers on all corners, a beautiful drapping fabic connected them. Fluffy and warm carpet, with familiar photos, books and paintings surrounding me. It felt like home. Well, maybe because it always was.\nMy grandma led me through the garden, letting me breath and get less infected air in my system. Her garden seemed effortlessly beautiful, like a over grownfield, atleast that's how big it was anyway. In the back of the garden, was a door. Engraved into the fence, it had flowers and leaves arching over it. The knob on the door was stiff and wooden, hard to the touch.\nI wouldn't rate this day as perfect, nor as even a postive experience. It wasn't negative, I just don't want to be here. That's what I gave as feedback at dinnertime, which my grandma just nodded to. I'm now in the bed, that doesnt have bedbugs, and doesn't have my.. feel to it. But, I just can't get the door out of my head, it feels like a call to me, like it's time to act. It's midnight, and sleeping in a old castle has unfamiliar sounds, the woo'ing and aaah'ing makes it frightening, and confusing in the dark.\nI reached out to my imagination. My.. intrusive thoughts. In my head it seems I'm walking out of th castle. I barely know where the bathroom is, but yet my mind seems to trail onwars into the garden. Opening my eyes I try to shake off the feeling of uncontrolled emotion, uncontrolled.. body. Before, I was on my bed. But now it seems I really am in the garden.\nI'm right infront of the door. I've actually walked the entire way through the castle, just letting something control me. The force controls me again, my hand slowly raises from my side, the tension between my hand and the door in undescribable. My hand touches the handle. My eyes are blinded, I can't see a thing, the light emerges from the door, as if it's... opening? The engraved door on the wall.. is opening. It's not fully opened, but i can still hardly see a thing from the light beaming into my eyes.. Controlled again, I start to step into the doorway.\nThe doorway led to.. somewhere. That's the best way to describe it. I'm not colourblind, but the colours don't look right, I never acknowledged the bright greens, and the deep greys, but everything is wrong. Right now, it's day. The sky is a plain crimson, and the grass a watery blue. After going through the door, I am back in front of it.  This time, I try at the door handle once more, it stays locked and hard.\nScreaming through tears, I find my way to my grandma, in the kitchen, making breakfast. \"I can't see.. I can't see...\"\n\"Of course you can't see through those tears! What's wrong?\" Her face kind and considerate, I begin to explain what had happened, mostly about the door. \"I understand. You see, this castle has a curse. No-one knows where that doors came from, I even stuided history at university, and I hvae no clue of it's origns, everywhere I look.\"\n\"And? Why am I blind!\"\n\"Let me finish. I am also like you, the sky a deep red, and the grass a watery blue. There's no way to reverse it, I can't help you.\"\n\"So I'm stuck like this?\"\n\"Yes.\"\nI experience life full of colour, maybe it's not right, but i can see. After three weeks as I was promised, I'm back home. I haven't told my parents, but I'm trying my best to research everything I can. History seems to be my strong suit, and I'm going to fix what that door did. What other curses did it do? How.. old is this door? My mind has already exploded with questions. Tired, and aches all over, I struggle to my bed. My room. Just, not any cochroaches. Waiting for a dream, I start to imagine colour like it was before the doorway.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 3 3 3 3 3\n"}

The surrondings were highly unfamilliar, cages were hanging\nall around her, the metal glinting slightly from the rain. Where was she?\nHer breaths were shallow, she strained her brain trying to figure out where she was last. She looks down at herself, a red braclet shines for a second in the moonlight. The chains around\nher shook, a couple screams came from her left. \"Other people...\" She whispers. They sounded like children, \"What is this place...\" She asks herself.The rain pours down on her cage,\nmaking little clinking noises. \"Hey-\" There was a voice next to her. \"Who's there?!\" She asks suddenly.

In the distance he can hear a clicking noise but he just ignores it.\nAfter a while the sky is navy blue and the clicking is getting louder as if something is getting closer and closer and closer, Tom picks up the pace making sure to look before every corner he trys to get through the Hedge but he just gets pushed away like before. The clicking is getting so close, Tom turns a corner and then he sees it but it doesnt see him its face is only white with black patches where its eyes and mouth would be. It has arms longer than its legs with claws the size on daggers and it has no hair. Suddenly it turns its head as if it was looking strait at him dead in the eye.

They shoot at the monster and then bring Tom back to there shelter.\nAfter a great nights sleep Tom learns that the monsters are called arm jackers, they use their clicking to get around as they dont have any eyes and they only come out at night.

'Every night the maze hedges change' Says the only surviver that has made it through the night.\nAt midday Tom eats lines up for lunch the flavours melt in his his mouth it is so good he has to sit down\nNear the end of the day Tom grabs a gun and boddy armor he is thinking about escaping 'it cant be that bad can it, i just can't run out of ammo.'Tom starts to pack a back pack he asks one of the cheffs for some food the cheff say he shouldnt go but if he does he better have food that lasts. Tom decided that he should go in the morning strait after dusk.\nIn the morning he sets off, he turns all sorts of courners right, left and around Tom gets out a meal made by one of the cheffs. He knows he can't sit down other wise he wont get far enough before the arm jackers come out.\nOnce the sky turns that violet orange he starts to hear the clicking but Tom just keeps the same pace. Once he finds an arm jacker he realises that there are to many but he has allready given his cover away but for some reason they don't chase him they just turn a courner. Tom starts to folllow them then they turn around but the strangest thing happens it says hello, Tom asks them why they arent chassing the arm jacker says they used to be humans but they stayed in the maze for to long and never got to return back to the shelter and when they did try to the  people tryed to kill us because they thought we were tring to kill them which is fair to be honest. But hey do you want us to show you the way out Tom thinks about it, 'yes please.'\nHe starts following them and once he sees the way out he shout with joy 'thank you thank you thank you!' Once he gets out he runs to the city catches a taxy to his house but then he realizes its not their then he sees adds for the Ollimpics 2060. Its been 57 years!\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 1 1 2 2 1\n"}
{"prompt":"The Water of Life\nThe water brushed past me as I swam closer and closer to the bottom of the sea. Visiblity slowly worstened as I reched to bottom, fish brushed past my leg tickling my legs and arms. As my vision slowly improved in i came to realize that this dark abiss was full of magnificent creatures that were hiden away from plain site.\nI pulled a camera out of my pocket and started taking photoes of the magnificent creatures, these creature were all different in there own special way. Some there fishes skin was glowing as if they to much makeup, they were all swimming in and around the coral reef that strerched across the whole ocean floor, it looked like ecosystem underwater. I turned around to see a big dark silhouet that had human arm but a fishes body, it swam off speedily before I could be certain.\nAs soon as I saw it, I rushed up to the surface rushing backed onto the boat. The glaring sun shone into my eye's and made me feel as if I was blinded. 'Done so soon 'tilly' barked the sailor.\t'There was something in the water it....I-I think it was...... a mermaid' that sentence slipped out of my mouth with no caution what so ever. The sailor stood up with his face in shock, he inched closer and closer to me, that same look on his face. He crept up and sat across from me and yelled 'You can't be serious... that is obsered,there not real your just imaging it.'.\nAfter a while my eyes felt better so, I filled up the air tank with more air, I slowly crept back into the water to find the 'So to speak mermaid'. As fast as lightening I swam into the egscart sam posion as last time to try and find. THE END FOR NOW\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 1 2 1 2 1\n"}
{"prompt":"The water of life\nBeep Beep Beep! The obnoxious noise of John's alarm clock woke him up, this morning was particularly quiet, then John realised that it was the water of life worship day. The water of life was a liquid with the properties of water but gives anyone  who srinks it immortality, it is in the middle of the town and every year the citizens go there and have ten minutes of  silence it is because hundreds of years ago the town was targeted by people as the majority of the citizens came there to escape from violence and such and one man drank the water and with immortality he survived the swarms of attackers and scared them off. If someone was to miss the water of life worship day they would be disrespected by most of the towns people.\nJohn rushed to the place when they when about to beginthe ceremony and got there just on time. He tripped over someones bag and fell into the well with the water of life. As the town was in the desert John never got swimming lessons and was not a good swimmer, struggling in the water, breathing frantically and trying with all his force to get out he accidently swallowed a mouthful of water when he began to slow down running out of strength he felt like he was being pulled up and he was. By what? how? John was now standing on the ground fully unharmed. Everyone was staring at him, soe random bloke from the crowd charged at his back with a pocket knife, John felt an impact on his back but it didn't hurt at all. John had the sudden realisation, everyone is now after him.\nhe ran as fast as he could but people were using cars to catch up to him. He saw something in the corner of his eye and it was a cave. Jhon had no Idea how to get there without being seen. He tried his luck by just stoppingand not getting seen. Jhon whas ran over by the car as if no one saw him, he felt weightless like he was a floating mind and he overheard a bloke say \"Where the hell did he go?\"                                                                                                           \"I have no idea,\" another voice said \"he is better off alone in the desert than in the town anyway\"                                                                                                                                                     \"I guess so\" said the first voice but with dissapointment                                                                  \"How about we go back now?\"                                                                                                                  \"Sure\"\nJhon was finally able to breathe normally. He started a fire in the cave to get comfortable. John was trying to find food, in the distance the engines roared and John started to breathe quickly again he started breathing quick again and the engine noise was getting closer and closer and he hear another voice yelling over the engines \"I see him!\"                                   \"Get him. What are you doing? Waiting for the sun to explode?\" And soon enough John was running but so tired and lethargic he couldn't run far so he was shoved into the back of the car.\n\"What happened?\" Said John sleepily                                                                                          \"Nothing, now answer us or you will be locked up.\"                                                                    \"What?\" Replied John                                                                                                                                \"I said, answer us or you will be locked up!\" Yelled the man. Jhon was confused and managed to run away with ease but everyone was after him.\nHe had escaped although he didn't feel free, he met some people who had also escaped form the town and they had made a camp that they planned to one day be a town. Suddenly Jhon's phone rung and it was his friend \"where are you mate? We've been looking for you.\" Said his friend                                                                                                                     \"I've escaped you will hold me hostage!\" Yelled John and hung up, he  ran far away from the camp to smash his phone so no one can track him. Jhon arrived back to his camp and got some rest. Although he is not very happy there he is living a decent life. He is living a freedome once again.\n\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 1 2 2 2 2 1\n"}
{"prompt":"The maze\n\"Please put your hands together for our final contestant...Jamie Storks!\"\nMy eyes flick open. Quiet. Chills go down my spine as I look at the walls beside me. Giant Bushes line the walls. I jump onto my feet and twirl around. Blocked. With no way of exiting, I entered the maze.\nA rumbling noise lures me closer as I take a left. Counting my paces as I go. 1...2...3. I stopped. Music flooded my ears. I gate lined the end of the alley, its lock engolfed in vines, tangling and climbing the metal edges. I bolt over climbing the fence as I go.\n\"Hello there! Have you come to play? Oh! we can build forts, Climb the merry-go-round and have lots of fun!\" A figure with a red cloak jumps infront of me. Yellow and red ribbons covered its neck and Pointy yellow elf like shoes on his feet. It seemed happy yet I feel like somethings not right.\n\" Uh...no... I don't have time, I have to get out of here.\" I mumble. Looking up at its face. A mask with yellow edges almost like a comical sun covered its face. A big wide smile drawn on with red paint.  A cresent moon covered the right side of the mask. I look around. Everything was grey. even...even the grass. Almost like it had been painted. I run past it scraping my foot on the cold broken down carasel. \"Ow!\" I screech. A gleaming dribble of ruby blood splashes on the ground. The music stops.\n\"Why...would... why would you do that!?\" The figure yells. \" Clean it up! Clean it up!\" The figure collapses onto the ground. Pulling at its mask. screaming. The world goes out of focus as a ringing in my ear starts as I grab onto my head.\n\"Now remember. There are 3 districts of the maze. one, the sun kingdom. The spirit there, sun, prides itself on its painting. It is a happy spirit, But get on its bad side and you won't last a minute. you see sun has an alter personality. Moon. As long as you don't get on suns bad side, you will be ok.\" \"Ok Jamie?\"\n\"ok.\"\nThe ringing stops. As the world comes back into focus. Moon.\n\"Naughty boy...Children must be punished...Children must obey.\" It stands up. The world goes black as red eyes glow in the light. A moon covers its face with stars covering the ears.   It grabs my arm as it crawls towards me. Metal. The ribbons unwrapped showing a metal neck. Run.\nI run out past the carasel. \"Naughty children must be punished\" It mutters, following me. I run around the corner and down the nearest alley. Left. Right. Right. Left.\n\"You can't run forever!\" It screeches.\nI keep going. Another gate marks the end of the turn. I leap up and over it. It scratches the metal as its head twists in a circle. The sound of claws on a chalkboard fills the air. I walk backwards as it turns around and walks away. I touch my arm. A cut runs from my palm to my pinky on where It grabbed my hand.  A sun comes from behind the clouds as I look up.\n\"I want...to go home.\" I mutter. A tear trickles down my face. \"Let me go...home.\"\nI put a hand on the wall and start walking, making sure not to let go of the wall. 1...2...3. The sun rises over the horizon as I feel a slight breeze on my face. The exit stood infront of me. As i run though I look at my hand, The cut slowly dissapears.  A smile forms on my face.\nFreedom.\n\n###\n\n","completion":" 2 3 3 2 3 1\n"}
