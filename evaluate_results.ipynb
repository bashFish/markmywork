Please rate the Question with a number between 0 and 3, where 0 is \"not at all satisfied\" and 3 is \"very satisfied.\".\\n\\nEssay: \"\"\"\\nThe Cage\\nThis was the city of Cage, where everything other than humans were trapped in cages for most of the time, the cows were in cages with 2 cows in one cage. The sheep and pigs were the same. Even the man\\'s best friend, dogs, were trapped in cages. Don\\'t ask me why, it was because of what happened here long, long, ago...\\n136 years ago\\nIt was a sunny and joyful place all those years ago. The air smelled of a fresh spring. The florist giving free flowers to anyone who walked by. The cows mooed happily as they munched on grass. The sound of singing fill the air. The citizens were celebrating the good fortune of harvest they had. They had enough crops to feed themselves and the animals, who were all free roaming around town. Every week, the butcher would hunt down one animal for the small town, making a delicious feast from it. This week was pig, so all the citizens went to bed that night dreaming about bacon and ham.\\nThe next morning was a dull day, as soon as the first of the citizens wake up though, the sky became bright blue. The trees danced happily in the light wind. There was one problem, the place was as silent as, well, nothing. There was no mooing, no oinking. Where was everything? They looked around, no animals to be seen.\\nSuddenly a lady screamed,\\' the crop shed door is open!\\' All the citizens gathered around the shed faster than you could say pigs. The butcher slowly walked in and saw a terrible sight. The animals were munching down all the crops! \\'We\\'re doomed!\\' wailed a young girl. A young man about the age of 19 had an idea though, to trap the animals into paddocks. So they did. It was ingenious. That kept the animals from eating all the crops, for 76 years...\\nIt was a beautiful day. The young man was now so old he could not even leave his house, but he was still celebrated as a savior. His house was all rusty, his photos were all covered in dust. This is the part when we get back to the cages, right about when the animals break out of the fences. Crash! The fences broke. After a brief meeting, they decided to go to the old man for help. He said after a while,\\' Maybe put them in metal cages, throw grass to them for feeding.\\' It was a success! The animals couldn\\'t break through. The next day, the man passed away. The whole town grieved.\\nPresent day\\nClaudia, a young girl, rushed through the streets, all the way to the alley full of animal cages. Discreetly, she fed all of them, even the ones dangling from high above. \\'I will get you out one day,\\' she whispered the the animals. She spent all her free time working on an early version of metal cutters. It was a very difficult job, but she managed to create one. Now she just needed a place to keep them.\\nClaudia resented the animals kept in cages, she resented he great-grandfather for the idea of trapping them. The anger burned her skin. For some reason, the animals were veryh obedient to her, so she freed all the animals and told them to stay in the alley. She then took all the cages and made a fence-like shape. Next, she placed all the metal fences around where the wooden fences used to be, and took the animals into the pen. The citizens all were very angry about this, but once they saw that it was very impossible for the animals to get out, they cheered wildly, and had a celebration. That was the end of the cages, and animal cruelty in this town.\\nNow, you may be wondering what about the dogs. If not, I\\'ll tell you anyway. It was simple, most of them were adopted, but the few that weren\\'t adopted, were trained by Claudia to guard the animals from a new threat, foxes and wolves. Now this is the end of this story.\"\"\"\\nQuestion: \"\"\"\\nHas the student written a compelling opening?\"\"\"\\nAnswer:',\n",

The sheep and pigs were the same. Even the man\\'s best friend, dogs, were trapped in cages. Don\\'t ask me why, it was because of what happened here long, long, ago...\\n136 years ago\\nIt was a sunny and joyful place all those years ago. The air smelled of a fresh spring. The florist giving free flowers to anyone who walked by. The cows mooed happily as they munched on grass. The sound of singing fill the air. The citizens were celebrating the good fortune of harvest they had. They had enough crops to feed themselves and the animals, who were all free roaming around town. Every week, the butcher would hunt down one animal for the small town, making a delicious feast from it. This week was pig, so all the citizens went to bed that night dreaming about bacon and ham.\\nThe next morning was a dull day, as soon as the first of the citizens wake up though, the sky became bright blue. The trees danced happily in the light wind. There was one problem, the place was as silent as, well, nothing. There was no mooing, no oinking. Where was everything? They looked around, no animals to be seen.\\nSuddenly a lady screamed,\\' the crop shed door is open!\\' All the citizens gathered around the shed faster than you could say pigs. The butcher slowly walked in and saw a terrible sight. The animals were munching down all the crops! \\'We\\'re doomed!\\' wailed a young girl. A young man about the age of 19 had an idea though, to trap the animals into paddocks. So they did. It was ingenious. That kept the animals from eating all the crops, for 76 years...\\nIt was a beautiful day. The young man was now so old he could not even leave his house, but he was still celebrated as a savior. His house was all rusty, his photos were all covered in dust. This is the part when we get back to the cages, right about when the animals break out of the fences. Crash! The fences broke. After a brief meeting, they decided to go to the old man for help. He said after a while,\\' Maybe put them in metal cages, throw grass to them for feeding.\\' It was a success! The animals couldn\\'t break through. The next day, the man passed away. The whole town grieved.\\nPresent day\\nClaudia, a young girl, rushed through the streets, all the way to the alley full of animal cages. Discreetly, she fed all of them, even the ones dangling from high above. \\'I will get you out one day,\\' she whispered the the animals. She spent all her free time working on an early version of metal cutters. It was a very difficult job, but she managed to create one. Now she just needed a place to keep them.\\nClaudia resented the animals kept in cages, she resented he great-grandfather for the idea of trapping them. The anger burned her skin. For some reason, the animals were veryh obedient to her, so she freed all the animals and told them to stay in the alley. She then took all the cages and made a fence-like shape.

The citizens all were very angry about this, but once they saw that it was very impossible for the animals to get out, they cheered wildly, and had a celebration. That was the end of the cages, and animal cruelty in this town.\\nNow, you may be wondering what about the dogs. If not, I\\'ll tell you anyway. It was simple, most of them were adopted, but the few that weren\\'t adopted, were trained by Claudia to guard the animals from a new threat, foxes and wolves.

In Athens, the worst day of the decade was coming. The high king, Papo, saw from his castle a ship bearing the flag of Crete. He saw the seven children tributes lining up at the docks. They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo\\'s son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him. All the other tributes accepted their fates, but he wouldn\\'t. \"Play it cool,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can escape The Maze. If I kill the beast that awaits us there, I can live as I have always lived in Athens.\" The boats arrived, took the tributes hostage, and sailed away to the worst island in the world.\\nOnce Bellapapo and the other tributes landed in Crete, the king, Minos, took them in for a celebratory feast on his castle. He announced that if the tributes survived the beast, they would go home with 10 ass-loads of gold. (Ass being a donkey, what did you think it meant)? The castle sat on a big hill, which was surronded by water. Bellapapo had an idea. \"If this guy thinks I am the son of a god, he will be reluctant to send me in.\" After the main course had been delivered, Bellapapo claimed \"I am the son of Posieden, god of the sea. If you dare put a demigod in The Maze, you shall feel the wrath of Posiedon!\"\\n\"Well, son of Posiedon,\" Drawled Minos, king of Crete,\" I am glad to host you. But you are a son of the SECOND most powerful god and from the SECOND most powerful city. I am the son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and rule the most powerful CITY!\" He screamed the last word, and as he did so, his ring flew out the window. Bellapapo, being ADHD and looking for something to do, ran and jumped out the window. King Minos thought: \"Ah well. We can do the trials with six kids.\" Meanwhile, Bellapapo was praying to Posiedon to save his neck. He noticed the waves were moving awkwardly. Suddenly, a wave lashed out of the water and coiled around Bellapapo like a snake, then tossed him to shore. He shrugged his shoulders, muttered a prayer to Posieden and truged up the hill back to the castle\\n\"Into the maze, the time is now. \\u2028You cannot live there\\'s no way out. \\u2028Into the maze and to the beast.\\u2028That will rip you with all his teeth.\\u2028Into the maze, and to your death.\\u2028For the trouble that you parents made.\"\\nThe locals were pumped that it was that time of year again. The weather was rainy, but they were taken aback when, unlike the usually cowards that they brought from Athens, one of the tributes seemed to be enjoying the attention. King Minos announced \"LET THE 3RD MAZE TRIALS, BEGIN!\" The tributes were thrown into the maze. Bellapapo told the tributes to hold onto a piece of string while he went searching for the beast. It didn\\'t take long. He found the beast at an intersection between somewhere and something. From the waist down it was human. From the waist up, it was a bull.\\n\"RAWR!\" Roared the beast.\\u2028\"RAWR!\" Roared Bellapapo. The beast charged, trying to catch Bellapapo off guard. Bellapapo sidestepped and hooked the beast in the snout. The beast didn\\'t seem fazed by it. He was used to pain. Those whips they used on him hurt more than anything else. Bellapapo kept on counter-attacking the beast, but it didn\\'t seem to get injured or tired. Bellapapo tried a different approach. He ran at the beast, jumped on its back and ripped off his right tusk. \"RAWR!\" Bellowed the beast. Bellapapo didn\\'t stop there. The clouds parted and the sun shone, a rainbow appeared as Bellapapo brought the tusk down onto the beasts head, killing it instantly.\\nCrete, Athens, Greece and the world was shocked. It wasn\\'t everyday you saw a mutant bull die to his own tusk. It probably would be put on 9news. Sadly, there were no TVs then. Bellapapo and the other tributes rejoiced of their freedom and hey, who doesn\\'t want ten ass-loads of gold shipped to your kingdom. (Again, an ass is a donkey). Bellapapo was elected the general fo the Athenian army, and his first campain was against Crete. Seeing as most of Crete hated Minos, they didn\\'t bother stopping him from taking over the country. And so, I\\'d like to say that they lived a long and happy life. Sadly, Minos faked his death. In reality, he was alive, and he sat with his most trusted advisors, plotting Bellapapo\\'s demise.\\nTO BE CONTINUED\"\"\"\\nQuestion: \"\"\"\\nHas the student written a compelling opening?\"\"\"\\nAnswer:',\n",

In Athens, the worst day of the decade was coming. The high king, Papo, saw from his castle a ship bearing the flag of Crete. He saw the seven children tributes lining up at the docks. They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo\\'s son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him. All the other tributes accepted their fates, but he wouldn\\'t. \"Play it cool,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can escape The Maze. If I kill the beast that awaits us there, I can live as I have always lived in Athens.\" The boats arrived, took the tributes hostage, and sailed away to the worst island in the world.\\nOnce Bellapapo and the other tributes landed in Crete, the king, Minos, took them in for a celebratory feast on his castle. He announced that if the tributes survived the beast, they would go home with 10 ass-loads of gold. (Ass being a donkey, what did you think it meant)? The castle sat on a big hill, which was surronded by water. Bellapapo had an idea. \"If this guy thinks I am the son of a god, he will be reluctant to send me in.\" After the main course had been delivered, Bellapapo claimed \"I am the son of Posieden, god of the sea. If you dare put a demigod in The Maze, you shall feel the wrath of Posiedon!\"\\n\"Well, son of Posiedon,\" Drawled Minos, king of Crete,\" I am glad to host you. But you are a son of the SECOND most powerful god and from the SECOND most powerful city. I am the son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and rule the most powerful CITY!\" He screamed the last word, and as he did so, his ring flew out the window. Bellapapo, being ADHD and looking for something to do, ran and jumped out the window. King Minos thought: \"Ah well. We can do the trials with six kids.\" Meanwhile, Bellapapo was praying to Posiedon to save his neck. He noticed the waves were moving awkwardly. Suddenly, a wave lashed out of the water and coiled around Bellapapo like a snake, then tossed him to shore. He shrugged his shoulders, muttered a prayer to Posieden and truged up the hill back to the castle\\n\"Into the maze, the time is now. \\u2028You cannot live there\\'s no way out. \\u2028Into the maze and to the beast.\\u2028That will rip you with all his teeth.\\u2028Into the maze, and to your death.\\u2028For the trouble that you parents made.\"\\nThe locals were pumped that it was that time of year again. The weather was rainy, but they were taken aback when, unlike the usually cowards that they brought from Athens, one of the tributes seemed to be enjoying the attention. King Minos announced \"LET THE 3RD MAZE TRIALS, BEGIN!\" The tributes were thrown into the maze. Bellapapo told the tributes to hold onto a piece of string while he went searching for the beast. It didn\\'t take long. He found the beast at an intersection between somewhere and something. From the waist down it was human. From the waist up, it was a bull.\\n\"RAWR!\" Roared the beast.\\u2028\"RAWR!\" Roared Bellapapo. The beast charged, trying to catch Bellapapo off guard. Bellapapo sidestepped and hooked the beast in the snout. The beast didn\\'t seem fazed by it. He was used to pain. Those whips they used on him hurt more than anything else. Bellapapo kept on counter-attacking the beast, but it didn\\'t seem to get injured or tired. Bellapapo tried a different approach. He ran at the beast, jumped on its back and ripped off his right tusk. \"RAWR!\" Bellowed the beast. Bellapapo didn\\'t stop there. The clouds parted and the sun shone, a rainbow appeared as Bellapapo brought the tusk down onto the beasts head, killing it instantly.\\nCrete, Athens, Greece and the world was shocked.

Bellapapo was elected the general fo the Athenian army, and his first campain was against Crete. Seeing as most of Crete hated Minos, they didn\\'t bother stopping him from taking over the country.

In Athens, the worst day of the decade was coming. The high king, Papo, saw from his castle a ship bearing the flag of Crete. He saw the seven children tributes lining up at the docks. They knew how short their lives were. Not one who entered The Creten Maze ever came back alive. Papo\\'s son, Bellapapo (Pronounced Bell-a-pup-OH), was one of the tributes. He was probably the best child warrior that Greece had seen. He had straight, brown hair and fierce eyes that reflected the sun. His long, slim legs allowed him to run at speeds that no Greek had ever run before. His ADHD brain was hardwired for battle. Now the ships were coming. He was a goner. Papo would have no heir, and his kingdom would be ruled by Crete for forever.\\nBellapapo stared at the ship as it glided towads him. All the other tributes accepted their fates, but he wouldn\\'t. \"Play it cool,\" he muttered to himself, \"I can escape The Maze. If I kill the beast that awaits us there, I can live as I have always lived in Athens.\" The boats arrived, took the tributes hostage, and sailed away to the worst island in the world.\\nOnce Bellapapo and the other tributes landed in Crete, the king, Minos, took them in for a celebratory feast on his castle. He announced that if the tributes survived the beast, they would go home with 10 ass-loads of gold. (Ass being a donkey, what did you think it meant)? The castle sat on a big hill, which was surronded by water. Bellapapo had an idea. \"If this guy thinks I am the son of a god, he will be reluctant to send me in.\" After the main course had been delivered, Bellapapo claimed \"I am the son of Posieden, god of the sea. If you dare put a demigod in The Maze, you shall feel the wrath of Posiedon!\"\\n\"Well, son of Posiedon,\" Drawled Minos, king of Crete,\" I am glad to host you. But you are a son of the SECOND most powerful god and from the SECOND most powerful city. I am the son of Zeus, the most powerful god, and rule the most powerful CITY!\" He screamed the last word, and as he did so, his ring flew out the window. Bellapapo, being ADHD and looking for something to do, ran and jumped out the window. King Minos thought: \"Ah well.

A squadren of heavily armoured soldiers march down the street, moving in unisen.  Their meant to protect us, but most of the time end up doing the oposite. I feel feet steping on my small hut, breaking through the thin layer of plastic that was protecting me from the elements. I have had enough with the soldiers abusing the less fortunate citizens. I catch one of them off gaurd when I reach out and rip one of thier guns from it\\'s holster. Dashing through the streets, I know they wont be able to follow with the bits of scrap metal poorly atached to their clothes. I start to realise, I will never be able to find my way back to my shelter. I have been living ther for 16 years! how could I just abandon my entier life, where I was born and raised?

The amount of food that I will need to keep me alive during my journey will be alot to find on the streets, but a couple trash piles should hold enough to keep me alive. The rain has stoped, wich means I can start my esacpe. slung over my shoulder is a small trash bag filled with everything I will need to survive. Food, Water and a blanket for warmth. I make my way through the winding walls of the city, trying to always go away from the central tower. Im looking down at the ground, when I bump into something. whiping my head up, I see a full squadren of soldiurs, betting on two rats fighting. One of them hears me and alerts the others. panic rising, Im frozen in place. The sound of a gun fiering snaps me out of it, but its to late. The bullet whent right through my leg. blood gushes out of the wound. I limp away as fast as I can, hearing the group go back to their game knowing I will die before from blood loss.

I slump against the cold wall, waiting for death to come, but the wall behind me starts to shift. I fall back and see sunlight filtering through the leaves. Leaves! I have found my way out. Mustering all the energy I can, I run towards The tree, but when I reach it, something seems wrong. The tree disapears and I realise, I havnt found my way out.

It\\'s small and cramped, but its the best that you can get in this city. Rain pours down on the plastic roof as i watch a family of rats scurry down the street. The city is a relic of the past, standing the test of time when others fell, but it is still not what it used to be. People living off the streets, scavenging for any little scraps of the rotten food they can find. I\\'ve heard rumers about what its like outside of the city and it sounds amazing. lush green feilds stretching as far as the eye can see. clear blue skys, unlike the dark poluted one inside the city. many people have tried and failed to escape. the city is like a maze, once you start moving, you will never find your way back. A squadren of heavily armoured soldiers march down the street, moving in unisen.  Their meant to protect us, but most of the time end up doing the oposite. I feel feet steping on my small hut, breaking through the thin layer of plastic that was protecting me from the elements. I have had enough with the soldiers abusing the less fortunate citizens. I catch one of them off gaurd when I reach out and rip one of thier guns from it\\'s holster. Dashing through the streets, I know they wont be able to follow with the bits of scrap metal poorly atached to their clothes. I start to realise, I will never be able to find my way back to my shelter. I have been living ther for 16 years! how could I just abandon my entier life, where I was born and raised? I find another small alleyway and and run towards it. It\\'s just now that I realise the size of what I just did. there is now way that I could resume my old life, its completly gone.

It might not be the best one, but it\\'s the only thing that I can think of. Gathering all the materials will be hard, but it will be worht it. The amount of food that I will need to keep me alive during my journey will be alot to find on the streets, but a couple trash piles should hold enough to keep me alive. The rain has stoped, wich means I can start my esacpe. slung over my shoulder is a small trash bag filled with everything I will need to survive. Food, Water and a blanket for warmth. I make my way through the winding walls of the city, trying to always go away from the central tower. Im looking down at the ground, when I bump into something. whiping my head up, I see a full squadren of soldiurs, betting on two rats fighting. One of them hears me and alerts the others. panic rising, Im frozen in place. The sound of a gun fiering snaps me out of it, but its to late. The bullet whent right through my leg. blood gushes out of the wound. I limp away as fast as I can, hearing the group go back to their game knowing I will die before from blood loss. The blanket I packed serves as a bandage, lessening the flow, but not enough to keep me concious. I strugle to stay awake, but its no use. I once again fall into a deep sleep\\nThe blood must have clotted at the wound, because I wake up again. its brighter, signiling that I have been asleep for at least a day. I check up on the bandage. soaked in blood, just like I thought. The pain is bearable though, so I start making my way through the city again, making shure im carefull around more densly opulated areas. After days of wandering, my food storage starts to run low. I try to keep up my normal pace, but my starving body forces me to go slower. Im eating my last scrap of food, making the most of the it. All hope seems lost, my food and water suplies have been depleted, and I dont even know if I have made progress. Lightheaded and starving, I reach a dead end. I slump against the cold wall, waiting for death to come, but the wall behind me starts to shift. I fall back and see sunlight filtering through the leaves. Leaves! I have found my way out. Mustering all the energy I can, I run towards The tree, but when I reach it, something seems wrong. The tree disapears and I realise, I havnt found my way out.

It\\'s small and cramped, but its the best that you can get in this city. Rain pours down on the plastic roof as i watch a family of rats scurry down the street. The city is a relic of the past, standing the test of time when others fell, but it is still not what it used to be. People living off the streets, scavenging for any little scraps of the rotten food they can find. I\\'ve heard rumers about what its like outside of the city and it sounds amazing. lush green feilds stretching as far as the eye can see. clear blue skys, unlike the dark poluted one inside the city. many people have tried and failed to escape. the city is like a maze, once you start moving, you will never find your way back. A squadren of heavily armoured soldiers march down the street, moving in unisen.  Their meant to protect us, but most of the time end up doing the oposite. I feel feet steping on my small hut, breaking through the thin layer of plastic that was protecting me from the elements. I have had enough with the soldiers abusing the less fortunate citizens. I catch one of them off gaurd when I reach out and rip one of thier guns from it\\'s holster. Dashing through the streets, I know they wont be able to follow with the bits of scrap metal poorly atached to their clothes. I start to realise, I will never be able to find my way back to my shelter. I have been living ther for 16 years! how could I just abandon my entier life, where I was born and raised? I find another small alleyway and and run towards it. It\\'s just now that I realise the size of what I just did. there is now way that I could resume my old life, its completly gone. The rain beats down on my skin as I fall into sleep.\\nThe world flutters in and out of vision, as I slowly regain consiosness. In my drowzy state, I make a plan. It might not be the best one, but it\\'s the only thing that I can think of. Gathering all the materials will be hard, but it will be worht it. The amount of food that I will need to keep me alive during my journey will be alot to find on the streets, but a couple trash piles should hold enough to keep me alive. The rain has stoped, wich means I can start my esacpe. slung over my shoulder is a small trash bag filled with everything I will need to survive. Food, Water and a blanket for warmth. I make my way through the winding walls of the city, trying to always go away from the central tower. Im looking down at the ground, when I bump into something. whiping my head up, I see a full squadren of soldiurs, betting on two rats fighting. One of them hears me and alerts the others. panic rising, Im frozen in place. The sound of a gun fiering snaps me out of it, but its to late. The bullet whent right through my leg. blood gushes out of the wound. I limp away as fast as I can, hearing the group go back to their game knowing I will die before from blood loss. The blanket I packed serves as a bandage, lessening the flow, but not enough to keep me concious. I strugle to stay awake, but its no use. I once again fall into a deep sleep\\nThe blood must have clotted at the wound, because I wake up again. its brighter, signiling that I have been asleep for at least a day. I check up on the bandage. soaked in blood, just like I thought. The pain is bearable though, so I start making my way through the city again, making shure im carefull around more densly opulated areas. After days of wandering, my food storage starts to run low. I try to keep up my normal pace, but my starving body forces me to go slower. Im eating my last scrap of food, making the most of the it. All hope seems lost, my food and water suplies have been depleted, and I dont even know if I have made progress. Lightheaded and starving, I reach a dead end. I slump against the cold wall, waiting for death to come, but the wall behind me starts to shift. I fall back and see sunlight filtering through the leaves. Leaves! I have found my way out.

It might not be the best one, but it\\'s the only thing that I can think of. Gathering all the materials will be hard, but it will be worht it. The amount of food that I will need to keep me alive during my journey will be alot to find on the streets, but a couple trash piles should hold enough to keep me alive. The rain has stoped, wich means I can start my esacpe. slung over my shoulder is a small trash bag filled with everything I will need to survive. Food, Water and a blanket for warmth. I make my way through the winding walls of the city, trying to always go away from the central tower. Im looking down at the ground, when I bump into something. whiping my head up, I see a full squadren of soldiurs, betting on two rats fighting. One of them hears me and alerts the others. panic rising, Im frozen in place. The sound of a gun fiering snaps me out of it, but its to late. The bullet whent right through my leg. blood gushes out of the wound. I limp away as fast as I can, hearing the group go back to their game knowing I will die before from blood loss. The blanket I packed serves as a bandage, lessening the flow, but not enough to keep me concious. I strugle to stay awake, but its no use. I once again fall into a deep sleep\\nThe blood must have clotted at the wound, because I wake up again. its brighter, signiling that I have been asleep for at least a day. I check up on the bandage. soaked in blood, just like I thought. The pain is bearable though, so I start making my way through the city again, making shure im carefull around more densly opulated areas. After days of wandering, my food storage starts to run low. I try to keep up my normal pace, but my starving body forces me to go slower. Im eating my last scrap of food, making the most of the it. All hope seems lost, my food and water suplies have been depleted, and I dont even know if I have made progress. Lightheaded and starving, I reach a dead end. I slump against the cold wall, waiting for death to come, but the wall behind me starts to shift. I fall back and see sunlight filtering through the leaves. Leaves! I have found my way out. Mustering all the energy I can, I run towards The tree, but when I reach it, something seems wrong. The tree disapears and I realise, I havnt found my way out. The walls are still around me, and I know I cant do anyhting to help, so I lay down, and Ebracing my last moments in this cruel world, and fade into the dark abyss of death.\"\"\"\\nQuestion: \"\"\"\\nHas the student used the five senses in their writing?\"\"\"\\nAnswer:',\n",

Jaaaakeee!\" Robert yelled out the front of the two-story black brown house standing next to a taller boy around the same age as him.\\n\"On my way!\" A boy replied as he rushed out the door with a small sling backpack, he slammed the door behind him and ran towards the two other boys, Robert and Larry.\\n\"This is gonna be sick!\" Larry squeled\\n\"Yeah, that\\'s why we are gonna do it, last year I asked mum and she said no cuz I was kinda young but now, we can finally gonna solve an escape room! Bye mum!\" Jake yelled as he kissed a goodbye.\\n\"Byeeee, don\\'t be late!\" Jakes mother replied, they ran towards the end of the street finding themselves infront of a small building called \"Hudson\\'s Escape Rooms!\" With a small red lightning bolt coming through the building. Jake walked in first as the others followed closely behind, he noticed the front desk was deserted and a mess. Then, a small particular red circle had caught Larry\\'s attention as he put his finger on it. Blood. \"OH MY- Theres, THERE\\'S BLOOD!\"\\n\"Where?\" Robert questioned as he moved towards the desk, \"Oh my god-\"\\n\"What!?\" Larry whispered\\n\"Loo- Look under the- the desk\" Robert replied as his face turned pale, and what lay on the floor under the desk was the receptionist, he lay there, rigid and still, as if he was dead. He was dead. Dead. Larry and Robert looked at each other, both with white faces speechless, and that\\'s when a thought came through Robert\\'s mind. \"Wait, where\\'s Jake!?\"\\n\"What do you mean he\\'s right behin-\" Larry stared as he saw a man behind obert, a black hood and brown coat with some dusty boots. Robert looked behind himself... \"ARGGHHH-\"\\n\"Wake up! Wake up! Robert! THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE DOSING OFF! Jake screamed as he shook Roberts frail body. \"HUH!? WHAT- WHAT HAPPEND!? The last thing I remembered was mme and Larry- you- then- WHAT!? What happend? Where\\'s Laryy!?\"\\n\"I- I don\\'t know, all I know is that I awoke here and then next second you were here somehow. But most importantly, where ARE we!?\" Jake replied as he looked around the green bushes, triple Jakes height. \"Let\\'s try and find Larry!\" Jake said\\n\" How!?\" Robert whispered\\n\"Lets just look around, maybe we might get luck-\" \"CRACK CRACK BOOM\" \"WHAT was THAT!? Jake screamed in horror as he noticed a stone pillar coming towards them, he looked behing and ran as fast as he could, Robert scrambled to his feet and when Jake made it the stone pillar would have crushed anything its way.\\n\"This place is WAY TO DANGEROUS BRO!\" Robert screamed as he panted heavily\\n\"YEAH, OBVIOUSLY!

Blood. \"OH MY- Theres, THERE\\'S BLOOD!\"\\n\"Where?\" Robert questioned as he moved towards the desk, \"Oh my god-\"\\n\"What!?\" Larry whispered\\n\"Loo- Look under the- the desk\" Robert replied as his face turned pale, and what lay on the floor under the desk was the receptionist, he lay there, rigid and still, as if he was dead. He was dead. Dead. Larry and Robert looked at each other, both with white faces speechless, and that\\'s when a thought came through Robert\\'s mind. \"Wait, where\\'s Jake!?\"\\n\"What do you mean he\\'s right behin-\" Larry stared as he saw a man behind obert, a black hood and brown coat with some dusty boots. Robert looked behind himself... \"ARGGHHH-\"\\n\"Wake up! Wake up! Robert! THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO BE DOSING OFF! Jake screamed as he shook Roberts frail body. \"HUH!? WHAT- WHAT HAPPEND!? The last thing I remembered was mme and Larry- you- then- WHAT!? What happend? Where\\'s Laryy!?\"\\n\"I- I don\\'t know, all I know is that I awoke here and then next second you were here somehow. But most importantly, where ARE we!?\" Jake replied as he looked around the green bushes, triple Jakes height. \"Let\\'s try and find Larry!\" Jake said\\n\" How!?\" Robert whispered\\n\"Lets just look around, maybe we might get luck-\" \"CRACK CRACK BOOM\" \"WHAT was THAT!? Jake screamed in horror as he noticed a stone pillar coming towards them, he looked behing and ran as fast as he could, Robert scrambled to his feet and when Jake made it the stone pillar would have crushed anything its way.\\n\"This place is WAY TO DANGEROUS BRO!\" Robert screamed as he panted heavily\\n\"YEAH, OBVIOUSLY! It\\'s gonna be night soon, we better find a way out of this place.\" Jake whined as a small bit of rain driped down from Jakes face. He looked to his side and Robert was no more. What was just a mere halucination as Robert had been long gone, when Jake made it out of the pillar, Robert wasn\\'t so lucky. Jake dropped down to the ground and started screaming and yelling, gallons of water came down from his face as his eyes shut.\\n\"A newcomer, must be, no other people would be in this hell hole\" A man boy said as they loaded Jakes body onto wheelcart. Jakes eyes were squinting, wanting more rest as he forced them open, but it was to much. He closed his eyes, not caring about anything in the world that he had let his friend perish...\\nSuddenly, Jake awoke to a bustling village with many people walking around the busy market streets, Jake lay in a bed which funnily enough was outside the house. He got up and looked about as a tall boy with a brown ripped shirt, \"looks like your awake, how do you feel\" the boy asked\\n\"Fine thank you, where am I?\" Jake croaked as he saw many kids running around the street.\\n\"You are in the west village kiddo, must\\'ve been rough losing your friend. Jake hadn\\'t replied as he remembered every moment vividly. \" Oh... uhm, sorry, my name is Khan, there was another newcomer to, do you know him? His name is Larry Choke?\"\\n\"Larry? Yeah I know him!\" Jakes sprits were raised a bit as he finally found Larry and got up and ran towards a small house, suddenly he froze. \"Where is he?\"\\n\"Hahaha, your a funny guy! So I assume you are close to him?\" Khan asked\\n\"Yes, we were friends since kindergarten, where is he?\" Jake replied\\n\"Over in that small house, you knew where he was up in there!\" Khan said as he pointed towards Jakes head, Jake said a quick thanks and sprinted towards the house as Khan retreated into the house muttering \"fool.\"\\n\"Larryyy! Larry! Larry? Helloooo!\" Jake shouted, something was off, the place was so dusty he could barely breath as he coughed, Jake walked around as the floorboards screamed in agony. Suddenly, a hand grabbed Jake into the wall and took out a pocket knife \"AARGH!\" Jake screamed as he kicked the dark figure into the wooden wall, the wall cracked as Jake came in for a punch, the figure dodged swiftly and side-stepped and kicked Jake in the stomach, James quickly backed away as his eyes told the mysterious person that Jake had really felt that kick. \"Who ARE YOU!? WHat do you want!?\" Jake questioned\\n\"I want- I want? I need\" The dark figure whispered as he went in for the finishing blow he grappled Jakes shoulder and twirsted his arm as he whispered \" I will make it quick.\" The figure elbowed Jakes right arm as Jake screamed in pain \"AGHHHH\" cursing under his mouth, then Jake side- flipped kicking the figure in the jaw as a few drips of blood flew out, \" I haven\\'t hunted for days!\" The mysterious preon yelled as he dashed towards jake, Jake dodged as he went for a left punch, his right arm unable to move. The figure caught his arm and threw Jake down to the floor, he took off his hood revealing his face, Larry. \"Larry!? WHY!?\" Jake yelled\\n\"No questions\" Larry smiled with a grin and that was the last thing Jake had heard, he closed his eyes, tears running down his face as he wanted to see his mum, he knew he would join his dad but he mostly wanted to see his little baby brother who was still so young, still an infant.\\nSuddenly, Jakes right arm had recovered somehow and came in for a right hook towards Larry\\'s cheek as it him him, Larry\\'s entire body ragdolled and was flung across the entire house as Jakes eyes glowed.

I could see someone comming towards me I diddn\\'t know who. They came rushing over and saying \\'oh you\\'re awake honey,\\' and hugged me really tight! I asked them, \\'who are you?\\' Everyone who was there seemed quite confused.  I felt like I was in a mental maze, who are these people where am I? I stayed in a bright light room for weeks.

Luccily I only stayed there for a bit.\\nI felt someone pushing my bed down the dreary hallway then I was put into a black car. With the person that said \\'oh honey,\\' to me. We drove for ages I think I fell asllep becuase when i woke up I was in a new bed and something was licking my face, I couldn\\'t imagine what it was but I opened my eyes to see a puppy all furry and cute, and two people standing at the door. I tried to get out of bed the puppy helped me. I walked very slowly the puppy led me to a small courtyard, I sat down while it layed on top of me. I could feel the warm furyness rubbing against me.\\nMe and the puppy who I called Rufus walked out to the small garden everyday. Then one day he was running around. I still diddnt have strength and I couldn\\'t remember anything but i got up slowly and did a small jog. At that pont I could remember one thing that I had a bedroom. Islowly had Rufu\\'s help up the stairs I saw a bed and layed down. I moved along in the mental maze! I just need to remember more I thought to myself as I stared out the skylight. Slowly one day after another Rufu\\'s helped me do more. Remember more. One day I even bounced on a trampoline. I just still couldnt remember where I am, Who I am, who are the strange people and how did I end up here?\\nOne day Rufu\\'s led me to the stange people they gave me hugs. They ran around the backyard with me they baked cookies with me they had fun with me. It all came back to me all the memories all the people all the friends and family I have.  I started to remember at that point who those people were. They where my Parents! I joggged over to them at the doorway and gave them a huge hug! I was out I was out of the maze! I did it!

My eyes have gotten used to it, the sight of people in agony.\\nWe are just trying to figure out why we are here. It smelled like metal. The last time i spoke with Jessie, which i dont know the time of,\\nall we said to each other was \"when do we get out\" and \"why am i here\". Everyone here has been wondering that,\\nand the truth is i dont know if i will get out. People who i knew well are now screaming loudly,\\nand people who are usually quiet are screaming telling people to be quiet. Its not fun, I didnt get any sleep last\\nnight because of the sound of people banging on their cages. Hovering above death, looking it in the eye,\\nand then getting put back down, but today I got what i thought was good news. We are getting let out of our iron cages.\\nBut not to go back home, the man wore a white smiley mask, he had a suit on with a blue tie, and black gloves.\\nHe told us why we were here. \"The real reason why you all are here, is for my experiment. You are all dead. You are\\nall well aware that deaths wrath has brought you down. Fortunately for you all, you have been selected for my\\nlittle puzzle. im sure you all want redemption and i am conscious of your measures for a second chance. That is why\\nthis isnt easy. But, since you arent supposed to be here in the first place, you will do anything, isnt that\\nright?\" A few people nodded, i was one of them. I looked Summer in the eye, who looked more depressed than a kid\\noutside freezing in a misty morning winter. But i dont care about that. We always had a grudge, but she took it\\none step too far. Im not sure if she intentionally pushed me onto that road, getting me run over. Maybe she wasnt\\naware there was a car there, but i somehow doubt that. When we were let out of our cage, i ignored her.\\n\"So, congratulations. Lets not waste any time, shall we?\"\\n\"The first game is simple, you will roll a dice, the highest number moves on. i will pair you all up.\"\\nI was paired up with summer, and I wasnt complaining. Finally, my chance to do what she did to me. We didnt say\\nanything to each other, we rolled a dice, and i had the highest number. I watched her slowly fade away, becoming the dim that surrounded us.\\nThen there were 6 of us, and shadows started creeping around the place. like skeletons. \"For the next one, there are 2 tunnels, only one is safe.\"\\nI went through the second tunnel with jessie, and it was very cavey, Sunless and unlit. A cross eyed figure stared at me, it looked more and more like me\\nas i edged closer. It let out a loud scream and i realised i went through the wrong tunnel. It ran towards me, a blank expression on its face, its arms\\nwere ragdolled and facing straight down. It ran towards me like a zombie, and me and jessie darted around the place, we didnt care where anything lead, we\\nwere just rushing around the place. \"come on, just a little more.\"And then i realised i was grabbing a limb. I grabbed 2 barrels i found, and used them as leverage. I stared at the different form of myself, looking it in\\nthe eye. I was on my own. I grabbed the barrel, hopped in and accidentally rolled into some water.\"\"\"\\nQuestion: \"\"\"\\nHas the student written a compelling opening?\"\"\"\\nAnswer:',\n",

Its not fun, I didnt get any sleep last\\nnight because of the sound of people banging on their cages. Hovering above death, looking it in the eye,\\nand then getting put back down, but today I got what i thought was good news. We are getting let out of our iron cages.\\nBut not to go back home, the man wore a white smiley mask, he had a suit on with a blue tie, and black gloves.\\nHe told us why we were here. \"The real reason why you all are here, is for my experiment. You are all dead. You are\\nall well aware that deaths wrath has brought you down. Fortunately for you all, you have been selected for my\\nlittle puzzle. im sure you all want redemption and i am conscious of your measures for a second chance. That is why\\nthis isnt easy. But, since you arent supposed to be here in the first place, you will do anything, isnt that\\nright?\" A few people nodded, i was one of them. I looked Summer in the eye, who looked more depressed than a kid\\noutside freezing in a misty morning winter. But i dont care about that. We always had a grudge, but she took it\\none step too far. Im not sure if she intentionally pushed me onto that road, getting me run over. Maybe she wasnt\\naware there was a car there, but i somehow doubt that. When we were let out of our cage, i ignored her.\\n\"So, congratulations. Lets not waste any time, shall we?\"\\n\"The first game is simple, you will roll a dice, the highest number moves on. i will pair you all up.\"\\nI was paired up with summer, and I wasnt complaining. Finally, my chance to do what she did to me. We didnt say\\nanything to each other, we rolled a dice, and i had the highest number. I watched her slowly fade away, becoming the dim that surrounded us.\\nThen there were 6 of us, and shadows started creeping around the place. like skeletons. \"For the next one, there are 2 tunnels, only one is safe.\"\\nI went through the second tunnel with jessie, and it was very cavey, Sunless and unlit. A cross eyed figure stared at me, it looked more and more like me\\nas i edged closer. It let out a loud scream and i realised i went through the wrong tunnel. It ran towards me, a blank expression on its face, its arms\\nwere ragdolled and facing straight down. It ran towards me like a zombie, and me and jessie darted around the place, we didnt care where anything lead, we\\nwere just rushing around the place. \"come on, just a little more.\"And then i realised i was grabbing a limb. I grabbed 2 barrels i found, and used them as leverage. I stared at the different form of myself, looking it in\\nthe eye. I was on my own. I grabbed the barrel, hopped in and accidentally rolled into some water.\"\"\"\\nQuestion: \"\"\"\\nHas the student used the five senses in their writing?\"\"\"\\nAnswer:',\n",
